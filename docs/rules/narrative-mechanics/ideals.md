# Ideals

In _Fonts of Power_ every character, whether player-controlled or not, follows their own moral compass, weighing their loyalty and self-interest against their personal ideals as they choose their own path.

The standard setting uses five **ideals,** each of which is assigned a value from 0 to 5 for every character. These are excellent hooks for roleplaying, but also serve a mechanical purpose. As described in the Social Skills section of this book, it is much harder to convince people of the moral imperative of a course of action (or to ignore moral consequences) using the Guidance skill when you do not yourself believe in it.

When you are creating your character, set each of your five ideals to any value you want between 0 and 5. If you’re unsure, roll 1d6 - 1.

The higher your value in an ideal, the more willing you are to sacrifice your own self-interest, or the bonds you have forged with others, to uphold that ideal. If you have high values in each ideal, you will be better at convincing others of the importance of doing good. If you have low values in each ideal, you will be better at convincing others to overlook harm.

## Equality

Equality is the belief in the fundamental equality of all sentient beings, the importance of fairness, and the obligation to help those least fortunate. You focus on the plights of the downtrodden, and want to help them find the justice and respect that they deserve.

A character who believes very strongly in Equality might be willing to pursue violent, disruptive revolution in order to right the wrongs of the current social system. By contrast, a character who does not care at all about Equality might overlook the plights of the poor and oppressed while going about their business.

## Harmony

Harmony is the belief in peace, the sanctity of nature, and the importance of setting aside your differences to work together. You have faith in the idea that we’re stronger together, and that our history, environment and society are all worth preserving.

A character who believes very strongly in Harmony might prioritize upholding the status quo for the sake of societal stability, even it it is flawed. By contrast, a character who does not care at all about Harmony might ignore the needs of their community, placing their own needs first.

## Liberty

Liberty is the belief in the right for all sentient beings to select their own courses of action, the value of self-reliance, and the importance of diverse opinions. To you, self-determination is a prerequisite for self-actualization, and without that freedom we’re nothing more than cogs in a machine.

A character who believes very strongly in Liberty might be willing to tear down systems that help people because they infringe on others’ freedom. By contrast, a character who does not care at all about Liberty might feel comfortable forcing others to conform or obey in order to accomplish a goal.

## Progress

Progress is the belief in the advancement of knowledge to bring about a brighter future, a rising tide of productivity that lifts all boats, and the intrinsic value of wonderful things. Whether you are a brilliant artist, an enthusiastic teacher, a fearless explorer or an insatiable scholar, you’re working to make sure tomorrow is better than today.

A character who believes very strongly in Progress might overlook the harm that rapid change and new advances can bring to people used to the old ways of doing things. By contrast, a character who does not care at all about Progress may be willing to reject any new proposal because of the mere potential for damage to the local environment.

## Sanctity

Sanctity is the belief that some things or actions are abhorrent and others are essential. You might believe that morality is absolute, or that there is some natural order of things. On a personal level, you might have a ritual you have to do every day or a food you have to avoid and you find self-worth in staying true to your convictions.

A character who believes very strongly in Sanctity might be hostile to those who hold differing opinions about something that's important to them. By contrast, a character who does not care at all about Sanctity might recklessly break taboos.
