# Attrition Scenes
In many cases, the drama is not in whether a task is possible, but in how painful the road to get there will be. When, with enough determination and time, the outcome is a foregone conclusion, use an Attrition Scene. The party must attempt to complete their task through a series of challenging skill checks, facing complications whenever they fail.

In order to accomplish their goal, the party must complete a series of difficulty 15 skill checks. They might:
* Use Prowess (Athletics) to break down a door.
* Use Focus (Geomatics) to safely navigate through dangerous terrain.
* Use Expertise (Arcana) to research a powerful magical device before it can be put into use.
* Use Presence (Guidance) to win over allies to their fledgling rebellion.


Unless a complication rules out their previous approach, the party can continue to reuse it (or choose a new one).

The number of skill checks required should be set by the table (the worldspeaker may overrule this decision in the case of hidden information) in one of three ways:
* **Fixed number of successes required,** with the number of successes based on the difficulty of the task.
	* **Impossible:** You cannot wear down the golem guarding you just by singing really annoying songs. This approach will never work, no matter how many times you were to succeed.
	* **Grueling:** Exhausting the castle’s supply of food will not be easy. The party must achieve 3 successes to complete the task.
	* **Challenging:** Blasting our way out of this cell will take a while, and might attract unwanted attention. The party must achieve 2 successes to complete the task.
	* **Straightforward:** There’s rumors of bandits along this road, but it’s not far to the next town. The party must achieve 1 success to complete the task.
* **Fixed number of attempts** allowed or required.
	* Your execution is scheduled for three dawn’s from now. The party has three attempts to escape.
	* There are three waves of monsters attacking this settlement; but you may be able to stop some with your traps.
* **Gradual success,** where the party can choose to stop at any time to take home the rewards they have won so far.
	* The party is searching the ancient ruins for clues.
	* The party is attempting to Resurrect their fallen companion using a profane altar in the heart of an ancient temple.
	* The party is holding their position in the caldera of a volcano as they attempt to Enchant magical items.

When the party is holding a position in a font of power to accomplish downtime activities, such as crafting or resurrection:
1. Use a gradual success attrition scene.
1. Use the rules laid out in the Downtime Activities chapter to see whether the party was successful.
1. Make an additional difficulty 20 skill check using this system to see if the party attempts to hold off or avoid danger, suffering complications if the party fails.
1. The party may attempt to rest again, repeating from 2.

There are four possible outcomes, based on the result of the party’s skill check:
* **Abject Failure (≤ 11):** The party suffers two complications.
* **Failure (15-19):** The party suffers a complication.
* **Success (20-24):** The party earns a success.
* **Smashing Success (≥ 25):** The party earns two successes.

What those complications entail is up to the worldspeaker, and should fit the details of the scenario. However, here are some ideas to get you started:
* Reverse one of the party’s earned successes.
* Every member of the party gains a level of exhaustion.
* Reduce the size of the party’s Supply Die once.
* Something goes wrong, and they cannot continue to use the same method to complete the attrition scene.
* The environment the party is in becomes more dangerous in some way.
* The plot advances, or the party’s adversary somehow prepares.
* They lose the trust of an ally, and their loyalty decreases by 1.
* Combat encounter!
