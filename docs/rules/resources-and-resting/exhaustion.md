# Exhaustion

As your character exerts themselves, and pushes past their natural limits, they can become **exhausted.** Exhaustion stacks indefinitely, but you must eventually start making Prowess (Endurance) skill checks or die. You receive a penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks equal to the number of stacks of exhaustion you have accumulated.

You can suffer exhaustion by trying to stay conscious while on death's door, using the Essence Tap or Activate minor action, suffering a serious and persistent injury or by failing to take care of your body. Every day that you go without sleeping or drinking inflicts a stack of exhaustion. Every two days that you go without eating inflicts a stack of exhaustion as well.

Whenever you gain a stack of exhaustion that increases your exhaustion to a level greater than or equal to 7 + your Prowess, you must make a difficulty 10 Prowess (Endurance) skill check or die.

Remember that exhaustion penalizes your skill checks when doing so. You may not choose to gain a setback or opportunity when you fail this skill check, even if you are proficient in Endurance.

The only way to recover from exhaustion is by resting, or by using the Recover or Tend downtime activities.
