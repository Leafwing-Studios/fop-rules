# Essence

Essence is the magical energy of _Font of Power,_ permeating the world and pulsing through the veins of every creature, including your characters. It is innate and omnipresent, but the concentration of it varies from creature to creature and place to place. Too much essence can quickly make one sick, or cause other bizarre and unexpected results. As your character trains and practices, they become more adept with essence, able to draw deeper from their own reserves and capable of handling more powerful magical items without becoming overwhelmed.

Essence is spent to power your class features, allowing you to cast spells or perform remarkable feats.

Each player character has proficiency bonus × (6 + Focus) essence, which can be restored by resting or using the Essence Tap minor action.

## Essence Draw

Magic is your very life force: your concern should not be running out of essence, but whether overusing your powers will leave you drained beyond saving or accidentally kill you.

When you attempt to spend essence that you do not have, immediately regain essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Make a difficulty 15 Focus (Endurance) skill check. If you fail, gain one stack of exhaustion.

When monsters Essence Draw, they gain 2 stacks of exhaustion on a successful skill check, and 4 stacks on a failure.
