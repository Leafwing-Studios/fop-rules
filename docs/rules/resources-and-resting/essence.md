# Essence

Essence is the magical energy of _Font of Power,_ permeating the world and pulsing through the veins of every creature, including your characters. It is innate and omnipresent, but the concentration of it varies from creature to creature and place to place. Too much essence can quickly make one sick, or cause other bizarre and unexpected results. As your character trains and practices, they become more adept with essence, able to draw deeper from their own reserves and capable of handling more powerful magical items without becoming overwhelmed.

Essence is spent to power your class features, allowing you to cast spells or perform remarkable feats.

Each player character has proficiency bonus Ã— (6 + Focus) essence, which can be restored by resting or using the Essence Tap minor action.

Magic is your very life force: your concern should not be running out of essence, but whether overusing your powers will leave you drained beyond saving or accidentally kill you.

You can recover essence by using the Essence Tap minor action, replenishing your essence at the risk of exhaustion. When you attempt to spend more essence than you currently have, you automatically and immediately gain the benefits of the Essence Tap minor action, but only restore essence equal to twice your profiency bonus.
