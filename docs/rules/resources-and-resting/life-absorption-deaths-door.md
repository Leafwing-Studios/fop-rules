## Life
Life is the vital essence of every creature in *Fonts of Power,* representing their physical wellbeing and capacity to fight. Life is quickly recovered as creatures’ innate essence mends them back into the form they are meant to be, leaving them whole but completely exhausted.

Your life can never go below 0: instead, when your life reaches 0 you enter Death’s Door (see below), and must choose whether to slip into unconsciousness or continue fighting while risking death.

Player characters have maximum life equal to 5 × (level + 5). It can be restored through resting, self-healing magic (received at level 2) or consumable magic items.

## Absorption
Creatures can gain **absorption,** a short-lasting replacement for life points that represents absorptive armoring or a protective force. Damage taken is subtracted from your absorption before your life. At the start of each of your turns, reduce your absorption by the amount of absorption you had at the end of your last turn, to a minimum of 0. Ordinarily, this just causes your absorption to be reduced to 0 at the start of each of your turns.

Absorption gained can stack, increasing the buffer of life points that must be dealt with before you suffer actual damage.

Occasionally, the distinction between **losing life** and **taking damage** can matter. Damage prevented (by absorption or the Block reaction or some other means) counts as damage taken, but not life lost. You only lose life when your life total actually decreases. When you pay life as a cost for an ability, you bypass these effects as well.

## Death's Door
While you are at 0 life, you are on **Death’s Door** and cannot heal by any means.  At the start of each of your turns while on Death’s Door, you must choose whether to slip safely into unconsciousness or to stay conscious.

While conscious and on Death’s Door, you must maintain your concentration at all times (see the Combat chapter for details). Whenever you would lose life, you must make a concentration check instead. The outcomes are as follow:
* **Failure by 5 or more:** you die.
* **Failure by less than 5:** you slip into unconsciousness, and gain a stack of exhaustion.
* **Success by less than 5:** you stay conscious, but gain a stack of exhaustion.
* **Success by 5 or more:** you stay conscious

Remember that you have a penalty to all skill checks equal to your current stacks of exhaustion, including skill checks made to maintain your concentration.


Once combat (and other intense activities such as Chase Scenes) have ended, you automatically slip into unconsciousness as the adrenaline (or its strange analog) fades. 

At that point, other creatures can attempt to Rouse you with a successful Focus (Medicine) skill check. The difficulty of this skill check is 10 + the number of stacks of exhaustion that the unconscious creature has.

If this skill check succeeds, you regain consciousness and stabilize at 1 life. If this fails, or if no one attempts to rouse you, you instead regain consciousness and heal (regaining half your life like usual) when the party next completes a rest.

**Once you reach Death’s Door, you cannot heal in any way until you have been stabilized.**
