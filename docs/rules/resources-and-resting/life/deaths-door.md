# Death's Door
While you are at 0 life, you are on **Death’s Door** and cannot heal by any means.  At the start of each of your turns while on Death’s Door, you must choose whether to slip safely into unconsciousness or to stay conscious.

While conscious and on Death’s Door, you must maintain your concentration at all times (see the Combat chapter for details). Whenever you would lose life, you must make a concentration check instead. The outcomes are as follow:
* **Failure by 5 or more:** you die.
* **Failure by less than 5:** you slip into unconsciousness, and gain a stack of exhaustion.
* **Success by less than 5:** you stay conscious, but gain a stack of exhaustion.
* **Success by 5 or more:** you stay conscious

Remember that you have a penalty to all skill checks equal to your current stacks of exhaustion, including skill checks made to maintain your concentration.


Once combat (and other intense activities such as Chase Scenes) have ended, you automatically slip into unconsciousness as the adrenaline (or its strange analog) fades. 

At that point, other creatures can attempt to Rouse you with a successful Focus (Medicine) skill check. The difficulty of this skill check is 10 + the number of stacks of exhaustion that the unconscious creature has.

If this skill check succeeds, you regain consciousness and stabilize at 1 life. If this fails, or if no one attempts to rouse you, you instead regain consciousness and heal (regaining half your life like usual) when the party next completes a rest.

**Once you reach Death’s Door, you cannot heal in any way until you have been stabilized.**
