# Life
Life is the vital essence of every creature in *Fonts of Power,* representing their physical wellbeing and capacity to fight. Life is quickly recovered as creatures’ innate essence mends them back into the form they are meant to be, leaving them whole but completely exhausted.

Your life can never go below 0: instead, when your life reaches 0 you enter Death’s Door (see below), and must choose whether to slip into unconsciousness or continue fighting while risking death.

Player characters have maximum life equal to 5 × (level + 5). It can be restored through resting, self-healing magic (received at level 2) or consumable magic items.
