# Absorption
Creatures can gain **absorption,** a short-lasting replacement for life points that represents absorptive armoring or a protective force. Damage taken is subtracted from your absorption before your life. At the start of each of your turns, reduce your absorption by the amount of absorption you had at the end of your last turn, to a minimum of 0. Ordinarily, this just causes your absorption to be reduced to 0 at the start of each of your turns.

Absorption gained can stack, increasing the buffer of life points that must be dealt with before you suffer actual damage.

Occasionally, the distinction between **losing life** and **taking damage** can matter. Damage prevented (by absorption or the Block reaction or some other means) counts as damage taken, but not life lost. You only lose life when your life total actually decreases. When you pay life as a cost for an ability, you bypass these effects as well.
