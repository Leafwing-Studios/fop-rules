# Resting
Characters can recover their resources and shake off exhaustion by resting. In order to rest, the party must be able to eat, sleep and relax (at least in a relative sense). They should be somewhere relatively safe and deliberately attempt to take a break to make camp. When you rest:
* Recover all your essence
* Heal for half of your total life
* Remove one stack of exhaustion
* Perform a single **downtime activity**

The party can also spend one Resolve in order to immediately gain the benefits of a rest, other than the downtime activity, at any point while outside of combat.
