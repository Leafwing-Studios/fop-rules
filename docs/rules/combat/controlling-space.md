# Controlling Space
Keeping yourself safe from someone trying to stab you requires a great deal of active attention. 

Every creature has a **zone of control,** by default the tiles that it is immediately adjacent to.

Whenever you **enter and leave an opponentâ€™s zone of control in the same turn,** you provoke an **attack of opportunity,** leaving your guard down as you scramble to get past them. When this happens, they may spend their reaction to make an attack of their choice against you, so long as it does not cost essence. This is not limited to basic attacks: they may choose to hold you in place with a Grapple attack, trip you using the Shove minor action or even blast you with a spell.

You can improve your ability to control space with various arms affixes, such as:
* *reach:* The range of your melee basic attacks is increased to 10 feet, and your zone of control is increased to a 10 foot radius.
* *proactive:* Enemies provoke an attack of opportunity whenever they leave your zone of control.
* *reactive:* Enemies provoke an attack of opportunity whenever they enter your zone of control.
* *opportunistic:* Enemies provoke an attack of opportunity whenever they move from a tile that is within your zone of control into another tile that is within your zone of control.
* *zoning:* Your zone of control is increased to a 10 foot radius, but you can no longer use basic attacks, Shove or Grapple attacks for attacks of opportunity.
