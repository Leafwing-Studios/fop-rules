# Afflictions
**Afflictions** persist between turns, dealing damage over time that **triggers** when a certain course of action is taken. Afflictions are applied in **stacks,** which build up as you apply more of them but reduce over time (or when they are treated in some way). The first time during your turn that their trigger occurs, you take damage equal to the number of stacks of that affliction that you have. At the end of each of your turns, reduce the number of stacks each affliction by one.

If you gain afflictions during your turn and have not yet triggered that affliction this turn, you can still trigger it later in the turn if you would normally trigger it. As an example, consider the following situation:
1. You have no stacks of bleeding and attempt to retreat from an enemy.
1. They hit you with an attack of opportunity and apply bleeding to you.

If you were to keep moving after the bleeding had been applied, you would then take damage equal to the number of stacks of bleeding that had been applied. You could choose to stop moving at that point instead, and avoid taking damage from the bleeding.

## Aflame
At the end of your turn (before the stacks of this affliction are reduced), if you are in the same tile that you began your turn in, take fire damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Anguish
The first time during your turn that you take a major action, take umbral damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction. Spending your major action to take a minor action does not trigger this effect.

## Bleeding
The first time during your turn that you spend movement, take decay damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Brittle
After you lose life, take corrosive damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction that you have. This effect cannot trigger again until the start of your next turn.

## Rage
The first time during your turn that you take an action that is not an attack (i.e. does not involve making an immediate attack roll), take fire damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Temperance
The first time during your turn that you take an attack action (i.e. one that involves making an immediate attack roll), take radiant damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Unstable
The first time during your turn that you spend essence, take arcane damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.
