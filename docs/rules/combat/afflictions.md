# Afflictions

**Afflictions** persist between turns, dealing damage over time that **triggers** when a certain course of action is taken. Afflictions are applied in **stacks,** which build up as you apply more of them but reduce over time (or when they are treated in some way). The first time during your turn that their trigger occurs, you take damage equal to the number of stacks of that affliction that you have. At the end of each of your turns, reduce the number of stacks each affliction by one.

**The painful details of afflictions**

Afflictions, by design, may only trigger once for each turn that a creature takes. Sometimes however, the timing can get a bit tricky.

Many afflictions (such as _bleeding_ or _temperance_) specify that they trigger "the first time during your turn that [you perform a certain action]". However, if you gain an affliction during your turn and have not yet triggered that affliction this turn, you can still trigger it later in the turn (even if it's not literally the first time in the turn that you've taken that action). As an example, consider the following situation:

1. You have no stacks of bleeding and spend movement to attempt to retreat from an enemy.
2. They hit you with an attack of opportunity and apply 3 stacks of bleeding to you.

This leaves you with two options:

1. Continue your escape, and trigger the bleeding as you spend movement, taking 3 points of decay damage.
2. Stop moving, and avoid the damage due to bleeding.

## Aflame

At the end of your turn (before the stacks of this affliction are reduced), if you are in the same tile that you began your turn in, take fire damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Anguish

The first time during your turn that you take a major action, take umbral damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction. Spending your major action to take a minor action does not trigger this effect.

## Bleeding

The first time during your turn that you spend movement, take decay damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Brittle

After you lose life, take corrosive damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction that you have. This effect cannot trigger again until the start of your next turn.

## Rage

The first time during your turn that you take an action that is not an attack (i.e. does not involve making an immediate attack roll), take primal damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Temperance

The first time during your turn that you take an attack action (i.e. one that involves making an immediate attack roll), take radiant damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.

## Unstable

The first time during your turn that you spend essence, take arcane damage equal to the number of stacks of this affliction.
