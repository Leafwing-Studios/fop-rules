# Conditions

Conditions stack in duration. While you have at least one stack of a particular condition, suffer its effects. At the end of each of your turns, remove one stack of each condition you are suffering from.

## Aloft

While aloft:

- Melee attacks that you make have disadvantage.
- The efficacy of forced movement applied to you is doubled.
- You can pass through enemy tiles, and enemies can pass through your tiles.
- You ignore ground effects.
- You cannot spend movement to move into new tiles.
- At the end of each of your turns, you may shift once.

## Banished

You are sent to a strange, alternate plane of existence. While banished, you can only interact with other banished creatures. Creatures who are not banished can occupy and move through the same tile as you and vice versa.

Other creatures may use the Treat minor action (or other effects which remove conditions) to remove the banished condition, even if they are not themselves banished.

When this condition ends, reappear in the nearest empty tile. You can still perceive things normally in both worlds while banished, and you can still be seen by creatures in the normal world.

## Blinded

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks and all basic attacks against you have advantage.

## Blunted

You have disadvantage on all attacks.

## Chilled

You lose your minor action each turn, but like normal may spend your major action to take a minor action if you choose. You must spend twice as much movement as normal to travel.

## Crazed

Whenever you would make an attack, the target is chosen randomly from those within range of that attack, excluding yourself. You must spend your major action to make an attack, before spending any movement or taking your minor action. You are treated as an enemy for all other creatures and vice versa. You must take attacks of opportunity when presented with the option to do so.

When making a multi-target attack, select a creature at random normally. You must include that creature as one of the targets.

## Cursed

You have disadvantage on all special attacks and all special attacks against you have advantage.

## Defenseless

Damage dealt to you cannot be prevented by absorption or the Block reaction.

## Frightened

You have disadvantage on all special attacks. You cannot willingly move closer to the source of your fear if you know where it is. If a different source applies frightened to you, the object of your fear changes to the most recent source.

## Lethargic

You cannot take reactions.

## Pacified

You cannot make attacks (i.e. take any actions that involve making an immediate attack roll). You cannot make attacks of opportunity.

Whenever you lose life, remove all stacks of pacified.

## Rooted

You cannot spend movement.

## Taunted

You have disadvantage on attacks that do not target the creature who applied this condition to you. You must take attacks of opportunities against that creature if able. If a different source applies taunted to you, the object of your ire changes to the most recent source.

## Withered

You have disadvantage on basic attack rolls. You must spend twice as much movement as normal to travel.
