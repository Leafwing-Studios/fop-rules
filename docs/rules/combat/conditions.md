# Conditions
Whenever a creature is afflicted by a condition that they already suffer from, the duration stacks. At the end of each of their turns, the number of remaining turns decreases by one.

## Banished
You are sent to a strange, alternate plane of existence. While banished, you can only interact with other banished creatures. Creatures who are not banished can occupy and move through the same tile as you and vice versa.

When this condition ends, reappear in the nearest empty tile. You can still perceive things normally in both worlds while banished, and you can still be seen by creatures in the normal world.

## Blinded
You have disadvantage on all basic attacks and all basic attacks against you have advantage.

## Blunted
You have disadvantage on all attacks.

## Chilled
You lose your minor action each turn, but like normal may spend your major action to take a minor action if you choose. You must spend twice as much movement as normal to travel.

## Crazed
Whenever you would make an attack, the target is chosen randomly from those within range of that attack. You must spend your major action to make an attack, before spending any movement or taking your minor action. You are treated as an enemy for all other creatures and vice versa. You must take attacks of opportunity when presented with the option to do so.

## Cursed
You have disadvantage on all special attacks and all special attacks against you have advantage.

## Defenseless
Damage dealt to you cannot be prevented by absorption or the Block reaction.

## Frightened
You have disadvantage on all special attacks. You cannot willingly move closer to the source of your fear if you know where it is. If a different source applies frightened to you, the source of your fear changes.

## Lethargic
You cannot take reactions.

## Pacified
You cannot make attacks (i.e. take any actions that involve making an immediate attack roll).  You cannot make attacks of opportunity.

Whenever you lose life, remove all stacks of pacified.

## Rooted
You cannot spend movement.

## Taunted
You cannot make attacks unless they target the creature who taunted you. You must take attacks of opportunities against that creature if able. If a different source applies taunted to you, the source of your ire changes.

## Withered
You have disadvantage on basic attack rolls. You must spend twice as much movement as normal to travel.
