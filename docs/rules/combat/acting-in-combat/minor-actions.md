# Minor Actions

## Activate

Use a consumable, or temporarily attune to a magical item.

Choose one:

- Gain the benefits of a consumable magic item whose gear point total is less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. These are created using the Devise downtime activity.
- Consume essence crystals directly to restore essence. You may only consume an amount less than or equal to your proficiency bonus at a time. Restore essence equal to 5 times the number of essence crystals consumed.
- Temporarily attune (or unattune) to a magical item until the end of your next rest, ignoring your attunement limit. Like usual, the enchantment gear point total of these items must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus.

Using this action repeatedly risks **essence overload** as your body struggles to handle the intense magical energy. If you have used this action since you last completed a rest, make a Focus (Arcana) skill check. Gain 5 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by 1 stack for each 5 points of your skill check result.

**Priming consumables**

Some consumables must be **primed** before they are **activated,** such as consumables with the tripwire affix. In this case, the affix will specify how the consumable is primed, and what activates it.

In this case, the consumable’s effects (and the risk of essence overload) only occur when the activation criteria is met. Consumables may be **unprimed** by using the Activate minor action a second time before they activate.

## Break Grapple

Attempt to break another creature’s hold on a target, ending the grappled status on yourself or another creature within 1 tile of you.

To do so, make an opposed Prowess (Athletics) skill check against the grappling creature. If you are the creature that is grappled, you may use Agility (Athletics) instead. If you succeed, the grapple ends.

This also ends the grappling status on the creature that is grappling if this was the only creature they were grappling.

## Dash

Gain movement equal to half your movement speed.

## Essence Tap

Regain essence equal to three times your proficiency bonus and make a Focus (Endurance) skill check. Gain 3 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by 1 stack for each 5 points of your skill check result.

When you attempt to spend more essence than you currently have, you automatically and immediately gain the benefits of the Essence Tap minor action, but only restore essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

When monsters Essence Tap, they gain 6 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by their skill check result in the usual fashion.

## Expose

Make a melee Expertise attack against an enemy of your choice within your zone of control. If it hits, an ally of your choice (other than yourself) may make an attack of opportunity against that enemy.

## Guard

Attacks against you by a creature of your choice have disadvantage against you until the start of your next turn.

## Hide

If there is some plausible way to hide from your enemies, you may attempt a difficulty 10 Agility (Stealth) skill check. If you succeed, you are invisible to your enemies and your position is concealed from them until the end of your next turn. This effect ends immediately after you make an attack.

You have a plausible way to hide (per the definitions of this action) if, for all enemies, at least one of these ailments is true:

- you are invisible to them (via direct invisibility, heavy shroud, darkness, full cover or some other effect)
- you are obscured by at least two ailments (such as light shroud, dim light or partial cover)

For more information on handling stealth outside of combat, see the Stealth skill description, or the _Scenes > Trickery Scenes_ section.

## Interact

Interact with an object in your environment. You might pull a lever, quickly slash a rope, kick down a door, throw a torch or so on.

## Scan

Attempt to gain information about your surroundings using one of your skills. This might be:

- an opposed Focus (Perception) skill check to find a hidden enemy, pitting your Focus (Perception) against their Agility (Stealth) check results, revealing that creature’s position and breaking their stealth (but not any magical invisibility that they might have)
- an Expertise (Humanities) skill check to determine the tactics being used by your opponent
- an Insight skill check to urgently search for clues about your predicament
- an Focus (Anima) skill check to try to understand an ability or feature of your opponent
- a Focus (Medicine) skill check to estimate the current life and essence of a creature, according to the table below
- an Expertise (Arcana) skill check to determine the nature of a magical effect, according to the table below

| 10                              | Is this magic helpful, harmful, neither or both?   |

| 25                              | What exactly does the magic do?                    |

## Shove

Make a melee Prowess attack against a creature within your zone of control. If you hit, you may choose to either knock them prone or push them into an empty adjacent tile of your choice.

## Swap

Change the set of arms that you currently have equipped. This also allows you to completely stow your arms (and have no arms equipped), or draw them when you do not have arms equipped.

## Treat

Attempt to treat a creature within 1 tile’s injuries and ailments, curing a single ailment or mitigating a single affliction of your choice.

Select a ailment or affliction. If you succeed on a difficulty 10 Focus (Medicine) skill check, remove all stacks of the chosen ailment or half the stacks of the chosen affliction from them.
