# Major Actions

## Defend
Attacks against you have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.

## Grapple
Make an Agility attack against them. If you hit them, they are affected by the grappled status, and you gain the grappling status.

You may not make Grapple attacks while you have the grappled or grappling statuses.

You have disadvantage on Grapple attacks made against creatures smaller than a quarter of your size. You cannot make Grapple attacks against creatures that are more than four times your size.

## Reverse Grapple
Gain the benefits of the Break Grapple minor action to free yourself from a grapple. If you succeed, you may shift once, then immediately make a Grapple attack against the creature that was grappling you.

## Strike
Strike a target with your currently equipped set of arms. Make a basic attack against a creature or object within range of your current arms. The amount of damage that basic attacks deal (as well as any other effects that they may involve), is determined by the affixes of the arms used. See the Gear chapter for full details.
