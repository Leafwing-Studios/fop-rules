## Attack of Opportunity

Strike suddenly, taking advantage of an opening in your opponent’s defenses.

You may use any attack of your choice to make an attack of opportunity, so long as it does not cost essence and you meet the attack’s other requirements, such as being within range.

There are several ways to trigger this reaction. By default, you can make attacks of opportunity when:

- An enemy creature spends movement to both enter and leave your zone of control in a single turn. This occurs regardless of the order.
- Your ally hits an enemy with an Expose attack and designates you to capitalize on the opening they created.

Attacks of opportunity occur before the triggering action is complete: if an enemy attempts to run past you, you could make a Grapple attack against them, holding them in place just before they leave your zone of control.

Attacks which hit more than one creature can be used as attacks of opportunity so long as they meet the other requirements. However, you have disadvantage on any attack rolls made in this way against creatures other than the one who provoked the attack of opportunity.

## Block

After you are hit with an attack that would deal damage, you may spend your reaction to attempt to block the attack. If you do, reduce the damage received by 1d4 + Agility.

This occurs after any non-damaging effects are applied, but before damage is prevented by absorption. As a result, you cannot typically block attacks which successfully apply the defenseless or lethargic conditions.

## Dodge

Whenever you would be hit a basic attack, you may use the Dodge reaction. If you do, make an Agility (Athletics) skill check. If your skill check result is greater than or equal to the basic attack roll that hit you, the attack misses instead.
