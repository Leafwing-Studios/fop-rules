# Reactions

## Attack of Opportunity

Strike suddenly, taking advantage of an opening in your opponent’s defenses.

There are several ways to trigger this reaction. By default, you can make an attack of opportunity whenever:

- An enemy creature spends movement to both enter and leave your zone of control in a single turn. This occurs regardless of the order.
- An enemy in your zone of control loses life due to one of your allies' attacks, you may make an attack of opportunity against them.

You may use any attack of your choice to make an attack of opportunity, so long as it does not cost essence and you meet the attack’s other requirements, such as being within range.

Attacks of opportunity always occur before the triggering action is complete. For example, if an enemy attempts to run past you, you could make a Grapple attack against them, holding them in place just before they leave your zone of control.

Enemies do not provoke an attack of opportunity when they lose life due to self-inflicted damage, friendly fire, afflictions or tile effects.

Attacks which hit more than one creature can be used as attacks of opportunity so long as they meet the other requirements. However, you have disadvantage on any attack rolls made in this way against creatures other than the one who provoked the attack of opportunity.

**Should I Dodge or Block?**

On their face, Dodge and Block seem very similar, as a defensive reaction to avoid attacks.
To help make this decision easier for new players, we've laid out their respective strengths.

**Block:**

- works on any attack, rather than only basic attacks, Shove and Grapple
- guaranteed to work, rather than relying on a successful roll
- most effective against large attacks, or multiple expected small attacks
- will often result in you losing life still, triggering further attacks of opportunity (this can be helpful on durable frontline characters)
- scales with Prowess via arms affixes such as _brave shield_, _imbued shield_ or _towering shield_

**Dodge:**

- completely avoids attacks if it succeeds, rather than just halving them
- because you dodge an attack completely, your concentration is not tested
- because you dodge an attack completely, you do not provoke additional attacks of opportunity
- most effective against large attacks with low attack rolls (and so works well on characters with low basic defense)
- scales with Agility via your Agility (Athletics) skill checks and affixes such as _daring_ or _dodgy_

In short, if you are a burly frontliner, you probably want to Block, but if you're a lithe skirmisher or backliner you should lean towards Dodging. If you are a caster, pick whichever one is the least likely to cause you to lose life, risking your concentration and more attacks of opportunity.

## Block

Whenever you would be hit by an attack, you may use the Block reaction. If you do, the efficacy of all attacks made against you is halved until the end of the current turn.

## Dodge

Whenever you would be hit a basic attack, Grapple attack or Shove attack, you may use the Dodge reaction. If you do, make an Agility (Athletics) skill check. If your skill check result is greater than or equal to the attack roll that hit you, the attack misses instead.

## Track

When a creature uses the Hide minor action (including if they are already hidden) and chooses at least one hiding spot that is within 6 tiles of you, you may use the Track reaction. Like all effects with a range, this does not trigger if it is blocked by full cover.

Make a Focus (Perception) skill check. If the result is greater than or equal to the Agility (Stealth) skill check from their Hide minor action, all of their hiding places within 6 tiles of you are immediately revealed.
