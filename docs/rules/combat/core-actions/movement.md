# Movement
At the start of each round, each creature gains **movement** to spend equal to their **movement speed.** By default, creatures have a movement speed of 30 feet.

During your turn(s), you may spend this movement to travel across the battlefield. Unsurprisingly, you can spend 1 foot of movement to **travel** 1 foot. You may spend this movement at any point during your turn, and break it up as you please. For example, you could move out from behind cover, fire an arrow at your enemy using the Strike major action, and then spend the remainder of your movement to retreat safely.

In order to make sure creatures have a nicely defined position on the battlemap, movement is spent in 5-foot increments. When moving diagonally on a square grid, every second diagonal move that you make in a turn costs 10 feet of movement rather than the usual 5.

Some forms of movement that you might be more (or less) difficult than usual. While on **difficult terrain,** it costs twice as much movement to travel. The same is true for attempting to move while prone, or by swimming or climbing. If you have multiple modifiers to your movement speed (for example if you were affected by the chilled condition while crossing difficult terrain), they stack multiplicatively.

**You may not pass through tiles occupied by enemy creatures** unless they are prone. **You may not end your movement in a tile occupied by another creature** unless they or you take up zero tiles.

You may spend movement equal to half of your movement speed to **stand up from prone** (or lie down or take flight if you can fly. As you are not travelling, this is not doubled if you are affected by the chilled or withered conditions, or difficult terrain.

Sometimes movement occurs via **teleportation.** Teleportation does not provoke attacks of opportunity and ignores the effects of difficult terrain.
