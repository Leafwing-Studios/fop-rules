# Minor Actions

## Activate

Use a consumable, or temporarily attune to a magical item.

Choose one:
* Gain the benefits of a consumable magic item whose gear point total is less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. These are created using the Devise downtime activity.
* Consume essence crystals directly to restore essence. You may only consume an amount less than or equal to your proficiency bonus at a time. Restore essence equal to 5 times the number of essence crystals consumed.
* Temporarily attune to a magical item until the end of your next rest, ignoring the limits on the number of arms, armor or trinkets that you could normally be attuned to. Like usual, the enchantment point total of these items must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus.

Using this action repeatedly risks **essence overload** as your body struggles to handle the intense magical energy. If you have used this action since you last completed a rest, make a Focus (Arcana) skill check. Gain 5 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by 1 stack for each 5 points of your skill check result.

**Priming consumables**

Some consumables must be **primed** before they are **activated,** such as consumables with the tripwire affix. In this case, the affix will specify how the consumable is primed, and what activates it.

In this case, the consumable’s effects (and the risk of essence overload) only occur when the activation criteria is met. Consumables may be **unprimed** by using the Activate minor action a second time before they activate.

## Break Grapple
Attempt to break another creature’s hold on a target, ending the grappled status on yourself or another creature within 5 feet of you. 

To do so, make an opposed Prowess (Athletics) skill check against the grappling creature. If you are the creature that is grappled, you may use Agility (Athletics) instead. If you succeed, the grapple ends.

This also ends the grappling status on the creature that is grappling if this was the only creature they were grappling.

## Dash
Gain movement equal to half your movement speed.

## Essence Tap
Regain essence equal to three times your proficiency bonus. Make a difficulty 15 Focus (Endurance) skill check, gaining one stack of exhaustion if you fail.

When monsters Essence Tap, they gain 2 stacks of exhaustion on a successful skill check, and 4 stacks on a failure.

## Expose
Make a melee Expertise attack against an enemy of your choice within range of your currently equipped arms. This attack does not deal damage or apply any other effects, but if it hits, an ally of your choice (other than yourself) may make an attack of opportunity against that enemy.

## Guard
Attacks against you by a creature of your choice have disadvantage against you until the start of your next turn.

## Hide
If there is some plausible way to hide, you may attempt a difficulty 10 Agility (Stealth) skill check, becoming invisible (relative to certain creatures) and concealing your position until the end of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack.

For more information on handling stealth outside of combat, see the Stealth skill description, or the Scenes > Trickery Scenes section.

## Interact
Interact with an object in your environment. You might pull a lever, quickly slash a rope, kick down a door, throw a torch or so on.

## Scan
Attempt to gain information about your surroundings using one of your skills. This might be: 
* an opposed Focus (Perception) skill check to find a hidden enemy, pitting your Focus (Perception) against their Agility (Stealth) check results, revealing that creature’s position and breaking their stealth.
* an Expertise (Humanities) skill check to determine the tactics being used by your opponent
* an Insight skill check to urgently search for clues about your predicament
* an Focus (Animism) skill check to try to understand an ability or feature of your opponent
* a Focus (Medicine) skill check to estimate the current life and essence of a creature, according to the following table
* an Expertise (Arcana) skill check to determine the nature of a magical effect, according to the following table

Expertise (Medicine) check result | Information gained

5 | Is the creature above or below half life? Does it have any essence remaining?
10 | What percentage of life and essence are they at, rounded to the nearest 25%?

## Shove
Make a Prowess attack against a creature within 5 feet of you. If you hit, you may choose to either knock them prone or push them 5 feet into an empty tile of your choice. 

You cannot shove creatures that are more than four times your size

## Swap
Stow your current arms (or whatever else you may be holding) and take out another set of arms (or some other item).

## Treat
Attempt to treat a creature within 5 feet’s injuries and ailments, curing a single condition or mitigating a single affliction of your choice.

Select a condition or affliction. If you succeed on a difficulty 10 Focus (Medicine) skill check, remove all stacks of the chosen condition or half the stacks of the chosen affliction from them.
