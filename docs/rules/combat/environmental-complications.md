# Environmental Complications

## Ground Effects

Various effects, from glue to oil slicks to pools of acid to thorny underbrush, cover the ground. These are collectively referred to as **ground effects.** As you might expect, flying creatures ignore ground effects.

The most common ground effect is **difficult terrain,** which is difficult to cross, due to obstructions or unsteady footing or the like. While on difficult terrain:

- Double all lateral movement costs.
- Tiles covered with difficult terrain count as 2 tiles for the purposes of forced movement (other than teleportation).

## Visibility and Cover

In Fonts of Power, there are three levels of **visibility** that describe how well you can see other creatures or objects: **clear, obscured** and **invisible.** These descriptors are determined on the basis of both the character attempting to see and the target that is being seen: covering your eyes with your hands makes everyone else invisible to you, but not to anyone else.

If your target is clear, everything works normally. If they are obscured, you have disadvantage on all skill checks involving sight (typically Focus (Perception)). If they are invisible, you automatically fail any skill checks involving sight, have disadvantages on all basic attacks against them and they have advantage on all basic attacks against you. In addition, if you do not have another way to tell where an invisible creature is (such as the fact that they are making noise or shooting arrows), you must guess which tile they are in. You may use the Scan minor action to make a Focus (Perception) skill check opposed by their Agility (Stealth) skill in order to attempt to determine this if they are attempting to conceal their position (and you have any reasonable way to work this out.

Light is the most common and important driver of visibility. There are three levels of lighting: **bright light, dim light,** and **darkness.** Creatures are obscured while in dim light, and invisible while in darkness.

**Shroud** effects, such as a cloud of smoke, rain, thick underbrush or fog make objects both within them and seen from within them harder to see. A **light shroud** makes objects obscured, while a **heavy shroud** causes them to be invisible.

Physical objects can also affect visibility and, independently, provide **cover,** shielding creatures behind them from attacks. There are two kinds of cover, **partial cover** and **full cover.** Like visibility, cover is relative to both the actor and the target. Partial cover causes all attacks to have disadvantage, and would be provided by things like castle parapets, a pile of boxes or a sturdy tree. Full cover causes all attacks to have no effect (except in the case of ongoing effects such as the Weaver’s patterns or the Soulbinder’s pulses), and is commonly granted by things like being behind a wall or closed door or inside a creature’s stomach. Note that in cases where the effect does not physically originate from the attacking creature, cover needs to be calculated with respect to the target and the source of the effect. This is an important rule when, for example, a ball of fire explodes in mid-air, or the ground becomes covered in a dangerous effect.

Intervening creatures do not grant cover unless they are at least one tile larger than the target. If they do, they only grant partial cover, as they tend to both be actively moving and full of holes that might allow an attack to slip through.

In general, when a creature is behind partial cover, they are obscured to you, and when a creature is behind full cover, they are also invisible to you. Transparent objects, such as windows or shimmering walls of force are an obvious exception to this. Unless specifically stated, you do not need to be able to see creatures in order to target them with an attack.

## Height Tiers

Sometimes, cover takes the form of objects that can be climbed on, such as boulders, furniture or terraced gardens. When this is the case, treat these environments as having several tiers of height

Creatures can safely travel up or down a height tiers (either by forced movement or by willingly spending movement) by:

- spending two tiles of movement
- spending one tile of movement while flying or aloft
- spending one tile of movement when moving via teleportation

When you shift, you may travel up or down in this fashion provided you shift enough tiles in a row to end your movement on solid ground. You cannot split your climbing over several turns: at the end of your turn, you return to the height tier of the tile that you are standing on.

Spending movement in this way only moves you vertically; if, for examples, you are trying to climb on top of a table, you would need to spend two tiles of movement to move up, then an additional tile of movement to move from the tile on the floor to the tile above the table.

When determinining ranges, treat tiles as if they were one tile further away for each height tier between the attacker and the defender.
Height tiers provide different types of cover depending on the relative positioning of the attacker and the defender.

When a higher tier is in-between the two combatants:

- If the defender is prone, they have full cover.
- If the obstacle is one tier higher than the attacker’s position, the defender has partial cover.
- If the obstacle is two or more tiers higher than the attacker’s position, the defender has full cover.

When the combatants are at different height tiers:

- When the creature on the higher tier is on the relevant edge of their tier, no cover is granted.
- When the creature on the higher tier is one tile back from the relevant edge of their tier, both creatures have partial cover.
- When the creature on the higher tier is one tile back from the relevant edge of their tier, both creatures have full cover.

### Falling {docsify-ignore}

When falling from a higher tier to a lower one, characters take damage based on the height fallen. Jumping down to another tier inflicts falling damage but does not cost extra movement.

Falling deals 2d6 physical damage for each height tier that you fall, reduced by the result of an Agility (Athletics) skill check. For example, falling from the 3rd tier in an area, to the bottom (0th) tier would incur 6d6 physical damage. If you rolled a 13 on your skill check, the total damage would be 6d6 - 13.

Creatures that are flying or aloft do not take falling damage.
