# Attacking and Defending
Almost every offensive action, from swinging a sword to throwing a fireball at your enemy to tricking them with illusions requires making an attack. The attacker rolls a d20, adds their attack bonus, and then compares the result to the defender’s defense. If the result is greater than or equal to the defense, the attack hits. “Meets it, beats it” can be a useful mnemonic for remembering this rule.

Just like with skills, if you are attacking with **advantage,** roll two d20s and use the higher result. If you are attacking with **disadvantage,** roll two d20s and select the lower result.

Attacks use either your **basic attack bonus** (proficiency bonus + Agility), or your **special attack bonus** (proficiency bonus + Expertise)..

**Basic attacks** are attempts to strike your opponent directly, and use the mundane properties of your currently equipped set of arms. This might be a classic sword or bow and arrows, but it could also be a set of claws, a flaming torch, or simple magic emanating from an ancient tome.

Basic attacks are always made against the defender’s **basic defense.** This reflects the effectiveness of their armor and their ability to dodge or parry blows. A player’s basic defense is, by default, 12 + Prowess + Agility, but wearing armor replaces the 12 + Prowess component with its own basic defense.

**Terminology for special attacks**

Every special attack targets a different special defense corresponding to an attribute, and we need a fast way to distinguish this. This convention is best illustrated through an example. **A Focus attack, for example, is a special attack made against your target’s Focus special defense.** Add your special attack bonus (your proficiency bonus + your Expertise) to the d20 you rolled to make your attack, then compare it to your opponent’s Focus special defense to see if you hit. **You do not add your Focus to a Focus attack. The name refers to the relevant special defense.**
</div>

**Special attacks** are used for unusual effects and magical spells: attempting to trip your opponent, light them on fire, banish them to another realm or so on in ways that armor won’t help defend them from.

By default, each character is proficient in two special defenses of their choice. For special defenses that you are proficient in, your defense is 10 + your proficiency bonus + the corresponding attribute. For all other special defenses, your defense is 10 + half your proficiency bonus + the corresponding attribute.

Unless there are particularly strange extenuating circumstances (such as if your ally is being carried away on horseback, or very far away through a cloud of smoke), **you can always hit a willing creature with an attack without needing to roll.**

If an effect tells you to select a creature within range, or something to that effect, you can always select yourself as the target unless there is some specific reason that you could not.

## Critical Hits
Whenever you roll a 20 on your d20 while making an attack (no matter what type of attack it is), your attack inflicts a **critical hit** (if it would otherwise land). When this happens:
* Roll again for damage, adding it to the original damage rolled.
* Apply twice as many stacks of afflictions as usual.
* Apply twice as many stacks of conditions as usual.
* Double the effects of forced movement.

Some effects (such as the Lucky talent or the keen arms affix) can lower the **critical hit threshold,** allowing you to extend the range of numbers rolled which result in a critical hit. For example, if your critical hit threshold is lowered by one, any attack that you hit with where you rolled a 19 or 20 deals damage twice. These effects stack with each other. Determining whether an attack would be a critical hit is seperate from determining if it hits: rolls that are at least your critical hit threshold do not automatically make contact with your target(s), but are critical hits if they land.

Some effects, such as the Devout’s Avatar cycle of miracles, cause your attacks to deal **maximized damage.** This means that you treat the result of each die rolled as if it were the highest possible outcome. For example, if you were to hit your opponent with an attack that deals 1d6 + 3 damage and the damage was maximized, you would inflict 6 + 3 = 9 damage to them. This effect stacks with critical hits: if you land a critical hit with an attack that deals maximized damage, you deal twice the normal maximum damage. 

## Melee and Ranged Attacks
Attacks are either **melee** or **ranged.** You can always make melee attacks against creatures within your zone of control, but no further.

While you are in an enemy zone of control, ranged attacks that you make have disadvantage. The range of ranged attacks is specified in your ability’s description, or by the arms affixes of the weapon(s) you are using.

## Single Target and Multi Target Attacks

<div class="infobox">

**Faster area attacks**

To accelerate the pace of combat, you may roll the same attack made against multiple targets a single time, affecting all creatures whose defense it meets or exceeds. 

This has strange implications for the mechanics of combat even though the expected hit rate is the same (namely that lower defense creatures are always hit if a higher defense creature is), so we do not recommend calculating attacks this way unless you find it needed to speed up combat.
</div>

Attacks are either **single target** or **multi target.** Many features are half as effective when used with multi target attacks, in order to preserve balance but still reward you for hitting many enemies at once.

There are several commonly used terms to describe the area of effect of powers; their meaning is described in the table below.

**Types of area of effect**

Term | Description
-- | --
Cone | A 90 degree cone, expanding out from the origin (typically the caster).
Cylinder | A tall cylinder centered around the chosen point.
Line | A line, typically beginning at the caster and affects all creatures within length specified. Lines wider than 5 feet expand out from both sides of the original line.
Sphere | A sphere centered around the chosen point.
