# Acting in Combat
To simplify tracking how much a single character can do each turn, actions are sorted into one of three types: **major actions, minor actions,** and **reactions.** Actions refresh at the start of each of your turns; you can spend your major action and your minor action at any point during your turn. You can spend your reaction at any point before the start of your next turn.

Major actions are used for the primary activity in your turn: attacking, casting a spell, or focusing completely on defending yourself. **Major actions can also be spent to perform any minor action of your choice.**

Minor actions are useful for other small things that you might want to do in the middle of combat: carefully looking around, treating an allyâ€™s afflictions, shoving an enemy or so on.

Reactions are used to respond to emergent situations in combat: to strike at an opponent in an opening they leave for you, or to block an attack that they land on you. You may spend reactions at any time an appropriate trigger occurs, taking one of the actions specified in that description. If you have a feature that grants you multiple reactions, you can only spend one per triggering event.
