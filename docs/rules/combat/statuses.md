# Statuses

Statuses represent things that might occur to the creatures in the game, but do not follow the same rules as conditions or afflictions.

## Grappled

You cannot spend movement.

Forced movement against you is divided by the number of creatures in your **grappling graph,** but drags all creatures in your grappling graph with you, maintaining your relative positions.

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks except against the creature(s) grappling you.

You cannot make Grapple attacks.

## Grappling

This status (and the grappled status of the creature you are grappling) ends as soon as you leave the grappling range of that creature.

Whenever you spend movement, you must choose whether to move yourself, or the creature you are grappling. You may spend movement to apply an equal amount of forced movement to the creature you are grappling, so long as they remain within the range at which you can grapple them. Unlike other forced movement, this does not move you (but could move the rest of their grappling graph).

Forced movement against you is divided by the number of creatures in your **grappling graph,** but drags all creatures in your grappling graph with you, maintaining your relative positions.

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks except against the creature(s) you are grappling.

You cannot make Grapple attacks. You may end this status on yourself (and the Grappled status on your target) at the start or end of any of your turns.

## Flying

If you have the ability to fly, you can spend half your movement to take flight. While flying:

- You do not take falling damage.
- Melee attacks made against you have disadvantage.
- The efficacy of forced movement applied to you is doubled.
- You can pass through enemy tiles, and enemies can pass through your tiles.
- You ignore ground effects.
- If you cannot spend movement or are knocked prone you stop flying.
- You are immune to the effects of the aloft condition.

You may stop flying at any point during your turn by spending 5 feet of movement.

**This is not a flight simulator**

In this game, flying (as part of combat) is deliberately unrealistic, optimizing for fun and interesting gameplay that captures some of the fun of flight in fantasy combat without destroying the game’s balance or grinding combat to a halt.

If you find yourself worrying about whether you can outrange the archers on the ground, or how movement speeds work when you are in fact travelling in 3 dimensions, or whether your character can really fly while wearing a full suit of armor: you’re probably operating at the wrong level of abstraction. Be generous to the players and monsters who have invested in the ability to fly, and don’t use combat rules to resolve scenes that don’t have interesting combat counterplay.

Falling damage is determined on a per-scene basis due to **vantages** present in the environment (see the section on Environmental Complications later in this chapter). Rather than worrying about the biomechanics of coconut-laden swallows, and the amount of damage that said coconut would suffer when dropped from a tremendous height (and the damage that a hapless victim would suffer as it landed on their head), relax and enjoy the fiction and fun of the game for its own sake!

## Invisible

You cannot be seen using sight. Creatures who cannot see you are treated as if they were suffering the blinded condition with respect to attacks by and against you.

## Prone

You have disadvantage on basic attacks. Melee basic attacks have advantage against you, and ranged basic attacks suffer disadvantage. You can only move by crawling, spending twice as much movement as normal to travel, unless you spend half your movement speed standing up. Hostile creatures can enter your tile while you are prone, but may not end their on your tile.

You may voluntarily go prone by spending 5 feet of movement.

## Unconscious

You may not take major actions, minor actions or reactions. You cannot spend movement. You do not have a zone of control. You cannot benefit from any of your senses.
