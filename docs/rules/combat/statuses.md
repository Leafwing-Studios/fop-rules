# Statuses
Statuses represent things that might occur to the creatures in the game, but do not follow the same rules as conditions or afflictions.

## Asleep
You cannot move or take actions and do not have a zone of control. When you first fall asleep, you become prone unless there is something holding you up. If you lose life, this effect immediately ends. At the end of each of your turns if you are in a loud environment (such as an active combat), you may defend against the effect which caused sleep, waking up if the attack misses. If the sleep is natural, you must pass a difficulty 10 Focus (Perception) skill check to wake up. The Treat minor action also wakes you.

## Grappled
You cannot spend movement. 

Forced movement against you is divided by the number of creatures in your **grappling graph,** but drags all creatures in your grappling graph with you, maintaining your relative positions.

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks except against the creature(s) grappling you.

You cannot make Grapple attacks.

## Grappling
This status (and the grappled status of the creature you are grappling) ends as soon as you leave the grappling range of that creature.

Whenever you spend movement, you must choose whether to move yourself, or the creature you are grappling. You may spend movement to apply an equal amount of forced movement to the creature you are grappling, so long as they remain within the range at which you can grapple them. Unlike other forced movement, this does not move you (but could move the rest of their grappling graph).

Forced movement against you is divided by the number of creatures in your **grappling graph,** but drags all creatures in your grappling graph with you, maintaining your relative positions.

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks except against the creature(s) you are grappling.

You cannot make Grapple attacks. You may end this status on yourself (and the Grappled status on your target) at the start or end of any of your turns.

## Flying

<div class="infobox">

**This is not a flight simulator**

Flying in combat in this game is deliberately unrealistic, optimizing for fun and interesting gameplay that captures some of the fun of flight in fantasy combat without destroying the game’s balance or grinding combat to a halt.

If you find yourself worrying about whether you can outrange the archers on the ground, or how movement speeds work when you are in fact travelling in 3 dimensions, or whether your character can really fly while wearing a full suit of armor: you’re probably operating at the wrong level of abstraction. Be generous to the players and monsters who have invested in the ability to fly, and don’t use combat rules to resolve scenes that don’t have interesting combat counterplay.

Falling damage is determined on a per-scene basis due to **vantages** present in the environment. Rather than worrying about the biomechanics of coconut-laden swallows, and the amount of damage that said coconut would suffer when dropped from a tremendous height (and the damage that a hapless victim would suffer as it landed on their head), relax and enjoy the fiction of the game for its own sake!

If you have the ability to fly, you can spend half your movement to take flight. While flying:
* You can pass through enemy tiles, and enemies can pass through your tiles.
* You ignore the effects of difficult terrain and other **ground effects.**
* Melee attacks made against you have disadvantage.
* Attacks against you which apply forced movement or knock you prone have advantage.
* If you cannot spend movement or are knocked prone you stop flying.

You may stop flying at any point during your turn by spending 5 feet of movement.

## Invisible
You cannot be seen using sight. Creatures who cannot see you are treated as if they were suffering the blinded condition with respect to attacks by and against you.

## Prone
You have disadvantage on basic attacks. Melee basic attacks have advantage against you, and ranged basic attacks suffer disadvantage. You can only move by crawling, spending twice as much movement as normal to travel, unless you spend half your movement speed standing up.

You may voluntarily go prone by spending 5 feet of movement.

## Restrained
You have disadvantage on basic attacks. Basic attacks against you have advantage. You cannot spend movement.

## Stunned
You may not take major actions, minor actions or reactions. You cannot spend movement. You do not have a zone of control.

## Unconscious
You may not take major actions, minor actions or reactions. You cannot spend movement. You do not have a zone of control. You cannot benefit from any of your senses.
