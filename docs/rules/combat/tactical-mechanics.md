# Tactical Mechanics

## Boons

**Boons** are benefits that you grant other creatures (typically your allies) that make them more effective in combat. The distinction mostly matters for effects which improve your boons, such as the supportive or encouraging talents. If a power has both positive and negative effects, it still counts as a boon.

Effects which qualify as a boon include but are not limited to:

- granting absorption
- granting resistance or immunity to damage
- granting advantage on attacks
- causing attacks made against them to have disadvantage
- removing conditions or afflictions, such as with the Treat minor action
- granting additional movement
- turning them invisible
- granting them the benefit of an action

Effects which do not, on their own, qualify as a boon include:

- applying forced movement or shifting creatures, even if the target is an ally

## Concentration

Many classes (Devout, Shamans, Soulbinders and Weavers) use **concentration** as a mechanic in order to maintain control over ongoing effects. Whenever you lose life while you are concentrating on an effect, you must pass a difficulty 15 Endurance **concentration check** to maintain your concentration or the effect ends. If you lost life due to physical damage, you must make a Prowess (Endurance) skill check. If it was elemental damage make a Focus (Endurance) skill check instead.

If the damage was a mixture of physical and elemental damage, the attribute used depends on the majority of damage (Prowess in the case of a tie). As a reminder, damage taken that is prevented by the Block reaction or absorption does not cause you to lose life.

If you are concentrating on several effects at once, make only one skill check each time you lose life; you lose concentration on all of them if you fail.

## Creature Sizes

The size of creatures is specified as the number of tiles they take up. By default, all player characters take up 1 tile. Large creatures such as horses may take up two tiles, and particularly huge creatures may take up three or four tiles, or even more! If a number of tiles that a unit is said to take up is inconvenient for your choice of battle grid, feel free to adjust the number of tiles slightly to make it fit comfortably. For example, a creature that takes up 7 tiles is very convenient on a hexagonal grid and terrible on a square grid.

Range is always calculated using the shortest path between the tiles that are occupied by the creatures in question. As a result, if two creatures are adjacent, they can always make melee attacks against each other, no matter how large they are.

Grapple attacks made against creatures larger than you have disadvantage, as do those made to grapple creatures less than a quarter your size. Creatures cannot make Grapple attacks against creatures which are more than four times their size.

As a special case, particularly small creatures, such as faeries, are said to take up 0 tiles. This means:

- They may occupy and pass through tiles that contain other creatures and vice versa.
- Their zone of control is limited to the tile that they are in. If their zone of control is extended, such as by the reach arms affix, the final radius is 1 tile smaller than usual.
- They can only Grapple or Shove creatures that are one tile in size.

## Forced Movement

Many effects, such as shoving an enemy or getting knocked back by a giant blast of wind, move creatures against their will. This is known as **forced movement.**

If a creature is **knocked back** or **pushed away,** they travel along the line between you and them away from you, ending in the nearest empty tile to their computed location. If they are **pulled towards** you, they travel along that same line, but move towards your current position.

Whenever you would be forcibly moved into an occupied tile, you are instead placed in the nearest empty tile instead. Unless a creature is moved by teleportation, attempt to maintain the direction of movement as best as possible while doing so. If the final location of a creature is ever ambiguous, the attacker chooses between the viable options.

Forced movement never provokes attacks of opportunity.

Modifiers to the strength of forced movement stack additively, but modifiers due to powers, affixes or any other passive features can never result in a change in the effectiveness of forced movement that more than doubles the effect of forced movement.
This can however be combined with the increased effect of critical hits and the flying and aloft effects, resulting in an absolute cap of four times the effect of listed forced movement.

## Shifts

Various effects allow you to carefully move across the battlefield. When you shift, you may move into an adjacent empty tile of your choice. This does not cost movement and never provokes attacks of opportunity.

Shifting is not forced movement. You can still shift even when you cannot spend movement (such as due to the grappled / grappling status or the rooted condition). If you are part of a grapple chain when you shift, the distance to each creature that you are connected to must remain within their respective grappling range.
