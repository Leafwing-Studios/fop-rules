# Rounds and Turns

When it becomes clear that a fight is inevitable, combat begins. First split the creatures into **sides,** which fight together as allies. Typically, this will be the player characters and the monsters. Then, each side determines the **turn order** they wish to act in, without seeing the choices made by any other side.

**Choosing turn order**

The order in which your turns are taken is typically not of tremendous tactical importance from combat-to-combat. You can speed up play by sticking to a standard turn order for your party, in which your frontline acts before your backline, or simply using the arrangement of players around the table.

Typically, each creature takes one turn per round, and act in sequence according the following rules:
1. The playersâ€™ side always takes the first turn. 
1. At the end of each turn, roll a d4.
	* 1-3: The other side takes the next turn in its turn order. If there are more than two sides, determine which side control passes to at random.
	* 4: The current side takes the next turn in its turn order.
1. Repeat until both sides have reached the end of their turn order.
1. Then. start a new round; rolling to see who starts the next round according to the last creature to take their turn in the round that is ending.

Particularly powerful monsters tend to take multiple turns per round; these must all be completed before the round can advance.


## Surprise Rounds
Sometimes, one side gets the jump on the other, either by hiding or suddenly lashing out with violence. When this happens, prepare the turn order like normal. During the first round, creatures which were surprised skip their turn.

Typically, an entire side will be surprised, but sometimes, such as when one character spots a hidden monster at the last moment, they will act while the rest of their allies do not.
