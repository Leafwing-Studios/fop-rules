# Fontborn
Magic breathes life into everything that it touches, and the fonts of power bubble with new forms of it: strange, alien and wonderous.

Often called monsters by the people of the cities and farmlands, some of these creatures have fought against the fonts’ influence and control, becoming fully sentient people with hopes, dreams and ideals of their own.

Banding together in a brilliant rainbow of diversity, these strange creatures live among the fonts of power themselves, still drawing on their energy for sustenance.  Their small communities thrive in harsh and bizarre conditions where other species must fight for their very survival.

## Primordial
Freshly forged in the places of great magic, the primordial fontborn form a motley crew, appearing to outsiders as sentient monsters and elementals. While the fontborn cannot reproduce directly, their connection to the fonts of power gives them an unusual talent for resurrection, which they use to continue their kind.

Still nascent and unstable, the fate and form of these creatures is in their own hands. Every fontborn must answer: who and what do I want to become?

## Ethereal
As fontborn age, they begin to fade into the mists, slowly becoming one with the elemental energies that gave birth to them. The elders of the fontborn, the Ethereal, are strange, otherworldly creatures who serve as respected, if eccentric, advisors to the communities that they grew up in.

Roll | What meaning do you find in your existence?
-- | --

**Disincorporate:** Whenever you take the Defend major action, you transform into a fine mist of elemental energy. Apply two stacks of banished to yourself. Tiles that you occupy while banished are lightly shrouded, and you may pass through even small cracks while in this form.

**Elemental Composition:** Choose an element when you gain this feature. You are immune to damage of that type, and vulnerable to damage of the opposite element.

**Accumulated Wisdom:** You are proficient in Guidance.

## Mutant
Whether they were tragic victims of a magical accident or saved from the brink of death by the strange energy of the fonts, other species end up mutated by the fonts more often than you might expect. Whether they rejoin their families and communities or choose to start fresh among the other fontborn, fontborn mutants forever bear the unique mark of their brush with power.

Roll | How did you become mutated?
-- | --
1 | I was subjected to the fonts’ energy as part of a terrible experiment.
2 | I was caught in a magical accident.
3 | I abused consumable magic items.
4 | I was left for dead but saved by the fontborn.
5 | I was brought to the fonts to be saved by their energy.
6 | I voluntarily mutated myself as part of a spiritual experience.

While they may share the basic features of the species they once were, every mutant must live with the powers they have gained for the rest of their life.

Gain the features of another base species of your choice instead of any subspecies features. If you select human, gain their Adaptable and Natural Craftsman features.
