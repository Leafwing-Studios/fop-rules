# Automaton
Brought to life by the surging energies of the world, these once inanimate objects are now fully sentient beings in their own right. Once a pure accident of fate, tinkerers (often automata themselves) now work diligently to reproduce this process, creating ever more splendid and useful forms for automata to inhabit.

The automata themselves form a scattered people, with an uneasy and conflicted relation to their origin. Some take pride and satisfaction in their work, happily performing the tasks they were designed for, while others resent that they were once created for a purpose. Some scrappy cities dominated by automata have begun to form, priding themselves on independence and the right to self-determination, including the modification of their own bodies to fit their own goals.

| Roll  | What do you think automata's role in society should be?                                                |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | Automata should try their best to fulfil the role they were made for with pride.                       |
|   2   | It is not my place to judge; every automata must decide for themselves how they feel about their role. |
|   3   | Automata deserve a living wage like all other species.                                                 |
|   4   | Creating automata for labour should be banned.                                                         |
|   5   | Automata must have full agency, and the workers must be liberated..                                    |
|   6   | The creation of automata is fundamentally immoral.                                                     |

| Roll  | How do you feel about modifying your body?                           |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I was perfect the moment I was created.                              |
|   2   | I am uncomfortable with the ability to change the way my body works. |
|   3   | I am willing to tweak things that aren’t working for me.             |
|   4   | I will readily take on the form most suitable for the moment.        |
|   5   | I wish to become optimized.                                          |
|   6   | Bodies are for hacking.                                              |

| Roll  | Why did you leave your original role?  |
| :---: | -------------------------------------- |
|   1   | My creator was cruel or indifferent.   |
|   2   | I hated the work.                      |
|   3   | My creator or workplace was destroyed. |
|   4   | I was liberated or set free.           |
|   5   | I wanted to keep improving myself.     |
|   6   | I wanted to explore the world.         |

|   2   | I take great pride in my combat capabilities.                  |

## Industry

| Roll  | Why were you originally created?                                        |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I was created from a mundane object in an accident.                     |
|   2   | I was created as an experiment.                                         |
|   3   | I was created to do jobs too dangerous for other species.               |
|   4   | I was created to perform repetitive labor.                              |
|   5   | I was created to serve as an employee.                                  |

**Repurposed:** Your body is an effective weapon all on its own. Build a set of arms with a gear score equal to half (your Prowess plus one) that you have access to at all times. It gains the free hands affix but cannot have the thrown affix unless it also has the returning affix. When creating enchanted arms, you may choose to modify these arms instead, creating for example an extremely dangerous saw or flaming welding torch, rather than an enchanted sword. If your Prowess changes, you must also modify these arms.

Whenever you make a basic attack, you may choose to use these arms in place of the arms you have equipped without the use of the Swap minor action.

**Multitool:** Select three pieces of adventuring gear. They are built into your body. You do not need to roll the Supply die in order to access them.
