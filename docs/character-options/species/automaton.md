# Automaton
Brought to life by the surging energies of the world, these once inanimate objects are now fully sentient beings in their own right. Once a pure accident of fate, tinkerers (often automata themselves) now work diligently to reproduce this process, creating ever more splendid and useful forms for automata to inhabit.

The automata themselves form a scattered people, with an uneasy and conflicted relation to their origin. Some take pride and satisfaction in their work, happily performing the tasks they were designed for, while others resent that they were once created for a purpose. Some scrappy cities dominated by automata have begun to form, priding themselves on independence and the right to self-determination, including the modification of their own bodies to fit their own goals.

### Features {docsify-ignore}
**Inexhaustible:** Exhaustion no longer applies a penalty to your attack rolls.

**Clockwork Biology:** You are proficient in the Tinkering skill. Any skill checks targeting you that would ordinarily use Medicine use Tinkering instead.

**Inorganic:** You do not need to eat, drink, breathe or sleep. However, you must be maintained, either by yourself or a skilled technician, for 4 hours per day or you begin to malfunction, suffering exhaustion as other species do when they don’t sleep.

## Combat

Roll | How do you feel about having been made as a weapon of war?

2 | I take great pride in my combat capabilities.
3 | I will use what I have been given to my own advantage.
4 | My origin as a weapon often makes me feel like I don’t fit in.
5 | I’ve removed what I can of my original capabilities.
6 | I hate that I was made to hurt people.

**Lock-On:** Whenever you use the Scan minor action, select a creature. You gain advantage on attacks made against that creature until the end of your next turn.

## Industry

Roll | Why were you originally created?
-- | --
1 | I was created from a mundane object in an accident.
2 | I was created as an experiment.
3 | I was created to do jobs too dangerous for other species.
4 | I was created to perform repetitive labor.
5 | I was created to serve as an employee.
6 | I was created to act as a successor for a retiring master craftsperson.

**Repurposed:** Your body is an effective weapon all on its own. Build a set of arms with a gear score equal to half (your Prowess plus one) that you have access to at all times. It gains the free hands affix but cannot have the thrown affix unless it also has the returning affix. When creating enchanted arms, you may choose to modify these arms instead, creating for example an extremely dangerous saw or flaming welding torch, rather than an enchanted sword. If your Prowess changes, you must also modify these arms.

Whenever you make a basic attack, you may choose to use these arms in place of the arms you have equipped without the use of the Swap minor action.

**Multitool:** Select three pieces of adventuring gear. They are built into your body. You do not need to roll the Supply die in order to access them.
