# Slime
Slimes appear to pop into existence spontaneously on the outskirts of fonts of power as not-quite-solid manifestations of elemental energy. Sentient and intelligent, they form societies and cities near fonts of power, searching for and taking in any of their kin that appear.

Their cities are vast and wonderous, composed of bubble-like structures attached by a network of pneumatic tubes that shoot the Slimes between the buildings at incredible speeds. When other species are nearby, they take on a humanoid form for the outsiders’ comfort, with each slime having its own preferred alternate appearance or appearances.

| Roll  | What sort of font of power spawned you? |
| :---: | --------------------------------------- |
|   1   | A place of natural power.               |
|   2   | A sacred place.                         |
|   3   | A magical disaster zone.                |
|   4   | A site of a terrible war.               |
|   5   | The ruins of an ancient civilization.   |
|   6   | A powerful magical city.                |


| Roll  | How do you feel about newly spawned slimes?               |
| :---: | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | Did we really need more of them?                          |
|   2   | I guess they don’t have anywhere better to go.            |
|   3   | We should educate them so they don’t cause us problems.   |
|   4   | I was once in their shoes, and I want to repay that debt. |
|   5   | We have a moral responsibility to raise them.             |
|   6   | Welcome to the family!                                    |


| Roll  | How do you use the flexibility of your body?                                |
| :---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I prefer to stay in my natural slime state when possible.                   |
|   2   | I’m most at home as a slime, but I’m willing to be polite around strangers. |
|   3   | I use whatever form is most useful at the moment.                           |
|   4   | I use the form I’m in as a means of self-expression.                        |
|   5   | I love exploring new humanoid forms.                                        |
|   6   | I have a particular affection for a specific humanoid form.                 |

### Features {docsify-ignore}

**Amorphous:** Your body is a stretchy, pliable, translucent ball of slime. You may shape it as you please using a minor action, including to carry items, interact with objects or wield arms, but you’re still visibly made out of slime and limited to the same total volume as a typical humanoid. You can only manipulate objects with two appendages at once due to limitations on coordination ability. Areas that are too thin become quite weak: you can apply the reach feature to your melee basic attacks, but all basic attacks made in this way have disadvantage.

You may collapse into a puddle as a minor action, and slide under doors and through narrow cracks so long as they are at least half an inch wide. Your gear and other bulky items that you are carrying magically squeeze through with you. You may not make attacks while a puddle, and basic attacks against you have disadvantage.

**Internal Storage:** Items you carry are stored inside your body, with the same inventory limit. They are plainly visible unless covered by clothing or the like.

**Uncertain Anatomy:** Critical hits do not deal extra damage to you, but still cause conditions and afflictions to be doubled. You do not need to breathe, but must still eat, drink and sleep. Slimes can see, hear and speak as well as a typical human, although how they do so is a closely guarded secret.

## Bouncy Slime

**Bounce Back:** At the end of each of your turns, remove an additional stack of each condition from yourself.

**Elastic Collisions:** Whenever you are hit by a basic attack, you are pushed 5 feet directly away from the source of that attack. The effect of all other non-teleportation forced movement on you is doubled.

**Sproing:** You never take falling damage and have advantage on all Athletics skill checks made to jump.

## Corrosive Slime

**Digestive Fluids:** At the end of each of your turns, apply one stack of defenseless to each creature you are grappling.

**Omnivory:** Once per rest, you may spend a minute to completely destroy a nonmagical, nonliving object no larger than you are, dissolving it and absorbing any remnants. Each time beyond the first each rest that you use this feature, you must succeed at a difficulty 15 Prowess (Endurance) skill check or suffer one level of exhaustion due to overconsumption.

You do not need to make Endurance skill checks in order to destroy edible objects with this feature.

## Sticky Slime

**Combat Glue:** Creatures have disadvantage on Athletics skill checks made to break free of your grapple using the Break Grapple minor action.

**Stuck to the Ground:** If you did not spend movement during your last turn, you are immune to forced movement.

**Tactical Adhesive:** You do not need to make Athletics skill checks to climb or stay attached to any surface.
