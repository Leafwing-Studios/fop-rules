# Awakened
Once ordinary animals, the awakened have been granted sentience and a more powerful form through their exposure to essence. Scattered outcasts, they band together as they explore the world and develop a culture and identity of their own that transcends their original species boundaries.

Diverse and rowdy, the awakened form an incredibly raucous group, living on the margins of most societies. They tend to be down-to-earth and kind, focused on the daily beat of existence and how to make it better for all those like them.

They come in all shapes and sizes: some bestial, and others more humanoid. No matter the animal, you can be sure that at least some have become awakened, with the capabilities to match their form.

**Backed into a Corner:** While you are at or below 20% of your maximum life you have advantage on all attacks.

**Untamed:** Your body is an effective weapon all on its own. Build a set of arms with a gear score equal to half your Prowess that you have access to at all times. It gains the free hands affix but cannot have the thrown affix unless it also has the returning affix. When creating enchanted arms, you may choose to modify these arms instead, creating for example magical tattoos or claw covers, rather than an enchanted sword. If your Prowess changes, you must also modify these arms.

Whenever you make a basic attack, you may choose to use these arms in place of the arms you have equipped without the use of the Swap minor action.

You may also build a set of armor in this way. If you do, gain its benefit at all times. It cannot be unequipped and you cannot equip other armor.
