# Crystalline
When essence is concentrated, all manners of strange things begin to happen. From time to time when a large number of essence crystals, naturally formed or deliberately hoarded, are stored together, a soul forms in them as they take on a mobile, sentient form. 

As the people of the world began to explore magic’s potential, this came as an unwelcome surprise to the rich and powerful, who were outraged to see their hard-won wealth begin to walk out of their treasuries. Brimming with readily accessible magical energy, they were an infuriating and lucrative target, and a terrible tragedy befell the newly nascent species. Survivors of this genocide fled, finding shelter deep within the earth among the few naturally formed beings of their own kind.

As eons passed, word began to trickle down to these enclaves, carved from stone itself, that cultural norms had begun to change on the surface. The Crystalline had begun to win rights and recognition as sentient creatures equal in worth to all other species. Although the survivors maintained their suspicion, scattered Crystalline have begun to live as equals among the cities of the surface. 

While other species have since learned to store essence crystals more carefully, typically in small and carefully guarded “dungeons”, the Crystalline deliberately gather them, creating new kin. 

In their sprawling, geometric underground cities, a cultural divide of their own has emerged, centered around the upkeep of their crystalline form. Like all other living creatures, Crystalline act as a personal wellspring of essence. Left unchecked, this causes them to grow chaotically in size and splendor over the years as more essence crystal accumulates on their body.

Two main factions exist: the Hewn and the Raw. The Hewn are beautiful, carefully carved deliberate creatures, shaped and polished by their own hand, while the Raw prefer to let their bodies grow in a natural fashion. This divide is the source of substantial political conflict, with each side sticking largely to their own kind and all sorts of other political issues falling along the same lines.

The Geodes stand apart from these two factions, largely shunned for their freakish rocky appearance and work quietly in isolation as inventors, hermits, and mystics.

| Roll  | How were you formed?                                        |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I was one of the initial beings that the survivors fled to. |
|   2   | I was formed naturally more recently.                       |
|   3   | I am the product of a magical disaster.                     |
|   4   | I was deliberately formed on the surface.                   |
|   5   | I was deliberately formed underground by other Crystalline. |
|   6   | I was one of the initial survivors.                         |


| Roll  | How do you feel about offering your body’s crystals for other creatures’ uses? |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | Even breaking crystals off for your own use is repugnant.                      |
|   2   | Doing so is an act of tremendous trust and intimacy.                           |
|   3   | In times of great need, it might be the right thing to do.                     |
|   4   | It is my right to do so, although I would rarely choose to.                    |
|   5   | It is an incredibly useful feature to be shared carefully with my allies.      |
|   6   | It is a perk of the way that I am, and a great way to earn a living.           |

### Features {docsify-ignore}
**Prismatic Lens:** Whenever you would make an attack that deals elemental damage and do not already have disadvantage on that attack, you may take disadvantage on that attack in order to select a new type of elemental damage for that attack.

**Crystalline Structure:** Crystalline cannot benefit from the innate affixes of armor. Instead, their basic defense is 16 + Prowess + Agility, and their movement speed begins at 20 feet. If you gain the Ascendant’s Natural Defense feature, your basic defense becomes 18 + Prowess + Agility + Presence, but you gain no additional benefit from that feature.

**Forbidden Snack:** As a minor action, you may break off a number of essence crystals equal to your proficiency bonus from your body, suffering 1 stack of exhaustion for doing so. These are very unstable however, and must be used before the end of your next rest.

Consuming essence crystals does not risk essence overload but you may no longer use the Essence Tap minor action.

**Crystalline Biology:** You do not need to breathe, eat or drink, and do not die of old age, but slowly shrink into nothingness if you are cut off from the world’s natural supply of magical energy, losing 1 tile in size every month.

## Raw

<div class="side-panel">

| Roll  | Why do you choose to let your body grow free?                           |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I prefer the way it looks.                                              |
|   2   | I don’t want to waste any growth.                                       |
|   3   | It was the way we were made.                                            |
|   4   | I value it as a symbol of our resistance to the oppression we suffered. |
|   5   | I refuse to conform.                                                    |
|   6   | It’s really just too much work to cut it into facets.                   |

</div>

**Raw Power:** Whenever you land a critical hit, refund the essence spent on that attack.

**Regrowth:** Remove an additional stack of exhaustion when you complete a rest.

**Naturally Grown:** When you select this subspecies, choose a size between 0 and 4 tiles. You occupy this many tiles; see the rules on Creature Sizes in the Combat chapter for effects.

|   3   | It’s what makes us civilized.                   |
|   4   | I want to fit in.                               |
|   5   | I enjoy perfecting the art.                     |
