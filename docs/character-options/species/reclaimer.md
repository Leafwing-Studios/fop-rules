# Reclaimer
Indiscriminate lovers of junk and treasure, the Reclaimers have an unending love for those things once discarded by society. Uniquely adapted to survive in very high-magic environments, they have a knack for crafting and using magical items.

Living in cluttered, rickety dens in the city, the Reclaimers compete ruthlessly among themselves to show off the very best bits of magic, knowledge, and art, both new and old. 
Scrawny, with short fur, rat-like faces, and big, floppy ears, they make good use of every piece of discarded junk from the species they live with, and are a welcome, if sometimes exasperating, addition to virtually every city.

| 4    | Books.                                 |

| Roll | How do you feel about the competitive nature of your society? |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2    | I do my best to ignore it.                                    |
| 3    | I simply put forward an earnest effort.                       |

**Insatiable Curiosity:** You may use the Activate minor action one more time each rest before needing to make a Focus (Arcana) skill check made to avoid essence overload.

**Scavenger:** You have advantage on all skill checks made during the Disenchant downtime activity. Whenever you use a consumable, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, it is not used up.

| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| 3    | The study of life and resurrection.             |
| 4    | The invention of new enchantments.              |

## Font-Congregant

| Roll | How do you feel about the gods you draw power from?                    |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | I don’t think they actually exist, but I sure seem to get results.     |
| 2    | I worship whoever is associated with the font of power I’m nearest to. |
| 3    | I make up gods to pray to every time, but it seems to work just fine.  |
| 4    | I pray to whichever seems most fitting at the time.                    |
| 5    | I think they’re all secretly one entity.                               |
| 6    | They are all sacred and worthy of sincere worship.                     |

**Syncretism:** Once per rest, you may pray to whatever god seems most fitting for the situation, gaining a benefit that would normally be earned by spending Resolve (other than to gain a rest).

## City-Scrapper

| Roll | What do you do with your inventions?                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Mostly they just pile up.                                           |
| 2    | I love showing them off.                                            |
| 3    | I sell them to the masses.                                          |
| 4    | I make them special for my customers.                               |
| 5    | I’m too busy improving on my designs to actually use them for much. |
| 6    | They make my life easier in mundane ways.                           |
