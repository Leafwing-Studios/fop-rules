# Reclaimer
Indiscriminate lovers of junk and treasure, the Reclaimers have an unending love for those things once discarded by society. Uniquely adapted to survive in very high-magic environments, they have a knack for crafting and using magical items.

Living in cluttered, rickety dens in the city, the Reclaimers compete ruthlessly among themselves to show off the very best bits of magic, knowledge, and art, both new and old. 
Scrawny, with short fur, rat-like faces, and big, floppy ears, they make good use of every piece of discarded junk from the species they live with, and are a welcome, if sometimes exasperating, addition to virtually every city.
