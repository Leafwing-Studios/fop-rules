# Reclaimer
Indiscriminate lovers of junk and treasure, the Reclaimers follow in the wake of the great events of the fonts: chasing after clues and picking up the artifacts left behind.
Uniquely resilient to the toxic effects of essence overload, they serve as scholars, archaeologists and adventurers, proudly showcasing their latest finds.

Short and scrawny, bedecked in assorted piles of gear, the true appearance of the Reclaimers remains a mystery. 
But everyone who has met oneremembers their glowing eyes: peeking out curiously from underneath oversized headgear.
The color of their eyes betrays their favorite sort of magical item, drawn like moths to a flame to the memories that they hold.

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Literal junk that has been neglected and unloved. |
| 2    | Shiny objects that attract attention.             |
| 3    | Mundane goods that were once beloved.             |
| 4    | Books and scrolls that hold important knowledge.  |
| 5    | Historically significant objects.                 |
| 6    | Works of art, now forgotten.                      |


| Roll | Why do you conceal your body with gear?                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | I love the sensation.                                           |
| 2    | There's so much to appreciate, so why not wear more?            |
| 3    | Wearing all this equipment makes me feel connected to the past. |
| 4    | It makes me feel safer to be surrounded like this.              |
| 5    | This is a time-honored cultural tradition.                      |
| 6    | I like the air of mystery it brings.                            |

| 3    | I make up gods to pray to every time, but it seems to work just fine.  |
