# Combat Talents
To make picking a combat talent easier, they are arranged below into categories below, matching either a **position** or a **role,** as defined in the introduction to the [Classes](character-options/classes/) chapter.

Every combat talent is also available as an affix, with a gear point cost of 1.

## General

### Blind
You can no longer see in the usual fashion. Instead, you gain an innate awareness of the 30 feet around you as if you could see in bright light. Within this radius, you are immune to the blinded condition and light and heavy shroud effects. Outside of this radius, you are treated as if you were suffering from the blinded condition.

### Chosen
Once per rest you may gain a benefit that would normally be earned by spending Resolve (other than to gain a rest).

### Lucky
Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll or a skill check made during combat, reroll the attack or skill check. You must use the new result.

### Nocturnal
Objects in dim light are no longer obscured, and objects in darkness are now merely obscured, rather than invisible.

### Patient
You gain access to the Wait minor action. When you use the Wait minor action, gain another reaction. Like usual, any unused reactions expire at the start of your next turn.

### Prepared
Once per rest when you use the Activate minor action, you may choose to gain the benefits of the Attune downtime activity instead of any other effect. This does not trigger essence overload.

### Resourceful
You may use the Activate minor action one more time each rest before needing to make a Focus (Arcana) skill check made to avoid essence overload.

### Versatile
Learn two additional powers from your class.

## Frontline

### Dependable
You have advantage on rolls made to determine how much damage is absorbed when you use the Block reaction.

### Enduring
You have advantage on Endurance skill checks made to Essence Tap and on concentration checks made while on Death’s Door. 

### Hearty
Remove two stacks of each condition from yourself at the end of each of your turns, rather than the usual one.

### Pragmatic
You have advantage on Shove and Expose attacks.

### Opportunistic
Enemies provoke an attack of opportunity whenever they move from a tile that is within your zone of control into another tile that is within your zone of control.

### Proactive
Enemies provoke an attack of opportunity whenever they leave your zone of control.

### Resilient
Choose an attribute. Special attacks made against you that target the specified attribute are made with disadvantage.

### Staunch
After you take the Defend major action, ignore any stacks of conditions or afflictions that would be added to you until the start of your next turn.

### Stout
You may now use the Block reaction in response to attacks that only apply forced movement but do not deal damage. When you use the Block reaction, prevent all forced movement that would be applied by the attack blocked.

### Upbeat
Remove two stacks of each affliction from yourself at the end of each of your turns, rather than the usual one.

### Vengeful
After you are hit by an attack by a creature that is in your zone of control, you may spend your reaction to make an attack of opportunity against them.

## Backline

### Blowhard
Whenever you make an attack on your turn and have not spent movement yet this turn, you may choose to cause all forced movement that you apply with that attack to be doubled. If you do, you may not spend movement until the start of your next turn.

### Coolheaded
You no longer have disadvantage on ranged attacks due to being in an enemy zone of control.

### Fastidious
If you do not have disadvantage on a ranged attack, you may choose to gain disadvantage on the attack and double its range.

Partial cover no longer causes your attacks to be made with disadvantage.

### Fierce
The first time each round that you hit a creature with a basic attack, you may spend essence equal to your proficiency bonus to gain four times that much life.

### Stubborn
On your turn, if you have not yet spent movement, you may choose to gain advantage on all of your attacks until the start of your next turn. If you do, you may not spend movement until the start of your next turn.

### Timid
At the start of your turn you may shift once. 

## Skirmisher

### Acrobatic
You may move through the tiles of hostile creatures.

### Daring
After you successfully use the Dodge reaction, you may make an attack of opportunity against the creature whose attack you dodged without spending your reaction.

### Deft
Whenever you take the Dash minor action, attacks of opportunity against you have disadvantage until the end of the current turn.

### Demure
After you hit a creature with an attack, they cannot make attacks of opportunity against you until the start of your next turn.

### Dodgy
You have advantage on Agility(Athletics) skill checks made as part of the Dodge reaction.

### Flexible
You may use Agility (Athletics) instead of Prowess (Athletics) to maintain a grapple. You have advantage on all skill checks made to escape a grapple.

### Nimble
Your Dash minor action now grants you additional movement equal to your movement speed, rather than half of it.

### Shifty
After you use your reaction, you may shift once.

### Spry
After you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may shift into any empty tile that is the same distance as you currently are from them.

### Swift
You may use the Dodge reaction to attempt to completely evade Agility attacks (including Grapple attacks).

## Striker

### Audacious
The critical hit threshold for your attacks is reduced by 2. Whenever you roll a 1 while making an attack, something goes horribly wrong, and you suffer the attack’s effects instead.

### Lithe
You have advantage on all skill checks made to use the Hide minor action in combat.

### Sneaky
When you miss a creature with an attack while hidden, you remain hidden and any invisibility you may have is not broken if it normally would be.

## Controller

### Burly
You have advantage on skill checks made to maintain a grapple. When you spend movement to move yourself while you have another creature grappled, you may apply the same amount of forced movement to them in the same direction.

### Merciless
After you apply at least one stack of a condition to a creature that already has a stack of that same condition, apply an additional stack of that condition. This effect does not trigger itself.

### Scheming
After you hit a creature with a single-target attack, you may shift them once.

### Rough
When you hit a creature with a Shove attack, you may choose to push them into any empty tile within your zone of control, rather than a tile within 5 feet of their previous position.

## Guardian

### Compassionate
You have advantage on skill checks made to use the Treat minor action.

### Darting
After you apply a boon to another creature, you may shift once. This effect only triggers once per boon applied, even for multi-target boons.

### Encouraging
After you apply a single-target boon to another creature, they may shift once.

### Protective
You may use your Block reaction to prevent damage that would be dealt to any creature within your zone of control, rather than just yourself. When you do so, you take any other effects of that attack in their place as well.

### Reactive
Enemies provoke an attack of opportunity whenever they enter your zone of control.

### Responsive
You gain access to the First Aid reaction. After another allied creature within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you may use this reaction. When you do, you may use any major or minor action that does not cost essence and applies a boon to the creature that was hit.
