# Creating Gear
Gear in *Fonts of Power* is always one-of-a-kind, created to match your exact specifications in both its aesthetics and function. The statistics and appearance of equipment in *Fonts of Power* are not tightly tied. The same item, in a mechanical sense, could be a mace, a sword, or a scimitar. When you craft or purchase an item, you decide on what it looks like and what it’s made of. Try your best to do this in a way that’s consistent with the affixes that define its mechanics, and the world around you.

You can take a look at the affixes available to create your gear [on our website.](https://data.fontsofpower.com/affixes) To help you get started faster, we’ve included some [prebuilt gear](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q8qNZ45ASF8R-W_Zg_Sw6TnDlidb-4T5y93zmADEJME/edit) for you, ranging from the standard to the fanciful.

All gear is crafted using downtime activities. In general, your gear’s innate properties are created using the Craftsmanship skill, then enchantments are added through either Animism, Arcana, Geomatics, or Tinkering. 

The skill used in crafting affects the aesthetics of the item, and the quirk it comes with. For example, a magical staff created using Tinkering might be a metal rod with a glowing gemstone, but the same item crafted using Animism might be a twisted oak branch with a monster’s eyeball.

## Beginning from a Base
Every piece of gear begins with a **base,** which is modified by any affixes that you add. 

The base used for arms is:
 * Damage: 1d8 physical
 * Range: Melee
 * Gear Points: 0

The base used for armor is:
 * Basic defense: 12 + Agility
 * Gear points: 0

While you are not wearing armor, your basic defense is 12 + Prowess + Agility. 

**Trinkets use a piece of adventuring gear as their base, and do not have innate affixes.** Adventuring is a very broad category: anything with some out of combat use, from a bundle of rope to a torch to a spyglass to an heirloom necklace works fine. See the [Prepared for Anything](rules/narrative-mechanics/prepared-for-anything.md) section in the [Narrative Mechanics](rules/narrative-mechanics/) chapter for more ideas.

**Innate affixes are restricted to common rarity.** There is no limit to the number of affixes an item can have: they can cost positive, negative, or zero gear points, letting you take on penalties in order to build items that are stronger in other ways.

## Enchantments
Enchantments enhance the power of your gear, powered by the entwining of your own essence and the magic woven into the item’s very fabric. Enchanted affixes work exactly the same way as innate ones do, with the following exceptions:
* Trinkets and consumables can have enchanted affixes, but not innate affixes.
* You can apply any rarity of affix as an enchantment, rather than being limited to common affixes.
* You must attune to a piece of gear before you can benefit from its enchantments.
* The gear point total is limited by your proficiency bonus, rather than your Prowess.
* Enchanted affixes are modified using the Enchant and Splice downtime activities, rather than the Craft downtime activity.
* Affixes of a rarity higher than common must be learned using the Research downtime activity before you can Enchant them.

**Essence crystals**

Enchanting gear requires essence crystals, the most important currency used by adventurers in Fonts of Power. Densely concentrated crystals of magical energy about the size of a marble, they hum and glow faintly with power. 

Essence crystals are essential for the creation and modification of magical items. Condensed magic in its purest form, they can only be acquired by venturing into the dangerous fonts of power that dot the world’s landscape, braving the monsters within as you explore its past.

## Crafting Activities
Interacting with the crafting system is done during downtime activities:
* **Attune:** Tap into an item’s magical powers so you can use it freely.
* **Craft:** Add, remove or modify innate affixes.
* **Harvest:** Gather essence crystals.
* **Research:** Learn the recipes to enchant new affixes.
* **Enchant:** Spend essence crystals to add or modify magical affixes that you know the recipes for while at a font of power.
* **Disenchant:** Turn an item back into essence crystals.
* **Splice:** Transfer an enchantment between two items.
* **Devise:** Create consumables for your party to use.

Lend a hand, make a deal or beg a favor; by combining your skills with your allies you’ll get the work done in no time. For detailed information on how this works, reference the [Downtime Activities](rules/downtime-activities.md) chapter.
