# Equipping Gear
Under the hood, every piece of gear in Fonts of Power is composed entirely of affixes. Each of these affixes has a cost, in terms of **gear points,** and the sum of these costs (the item’s innate or enchantment **gear point total**) determines whether or not you can equip it and gain its benefits.

In order to effectively use a set of arms or armor:

**sum of innate affixes ≤ Prowess / 2**

Do not round these values, even though numbers in this system normally round down.

If you do not meet these requirements, a piece of gear is treated as **unsuitable:**
* Unsuitable melee weapons deal 1d6 physical damage.
* Unsuitable ranged weapons deal 1d4 physical damage at a range of 30 feet.
* Unsuitable armor offers no benefit whatsoever. You are treated as if you were not wearing armor, and your basic defense is calculated as 12 + Prowess + Agility.

When a player attempts to use something that would not normally be used in combat as an **improvised weapon,** work together to determine a plausible set of affixes for it. If that’s not worth the hassle, simply treat the weapon as unsuitable. If a character is completely **unarmed,** their basic attacks deal 1d4 physical damage on hit at melee range.

You must use the **Attune** downtime activity (see the [Downtime Activities](rules/downtime-activities.md) chapter) in order to gain the benefits of its enchantments. You can only attune to a piece of gear if:

**sum of enchantment affixes  ≤ proficiency bonus**
