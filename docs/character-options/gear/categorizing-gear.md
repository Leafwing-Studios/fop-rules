# Categorizing Gear
*Fonts of Power* splits gear into four different **types:** arms, armor, trinkets, and consumables. Every affix is categorized according to these types, which define the types of benefits offered.

**Arms** are the weapons and shield that you use in your hands, and determine your ability to attack or block. Basic attacks are made using a single attack roll with the arms that you have equipped, whether they are:
* A single one-handed weapon
* Two one-handed weapons
* A single one-handed weapon and a shield
* A two handed weapon
* An enchanted book that improves your magical powers
* Your ferocious claws

Even if you never intend to make a basic attack, you can still equip and enchant arms in order to enhance or modify your magical powers.

The second type of gear is **armor,** which you wear to protect yourself. We abstract over the details: helmets, pants, chest pieces, boots, gloves and so on are all part of the same set of armor, and you typically gain the effect of your armor unless it is seriously damaged or most of the pieces are missing.

**Trinkets** are the final type of permanent equipment. These are magical items which give you access to useful and unusual powers and enable you to perform extraordinary feats. They may be an amulet, a ring, a pair of lucky boots, enchanted gloves, or a magical tattoo. Trinkets typically offer problem-solving tools: the ability to fly, a bonus during social interactions, an unusual talent for crafting or so on.

**Consumables** are single-use magical items designed to offer a temporary boost in power. They might be a potion of healing, a poison that coats your blade, a scroll with ancient magic or a devious trap. Consumables are created using the affix system and the Devise downtime activity, and used with the Activate minor action. Over-use of consumables can have serious consequences as your body is flooded with magical energy, suffering exhaustion due to essence overload.

Affixes come in four different **rarities,** which reflect their in-game mechanical complexity and change how difficult they are to research and craft: **common, advanced, exotic,** and **prismatic.**

Prismatic affixes are incredibly rare and powerful, comparable to the **capstone** features that you receive upon reaching level 20 in a class. **You can only benefit from a single prismatic affix at a time, and must have a proficiency bonus of at least +5 in order to do so.**

Affixes can be applied either as **innate affixes** or **enchanted affixes** (sometimes called **enchantments**). Innate affixes determine the basic properties of the gear, such as a weapon’s reach, or whether a set of armor is covered in lacerating spikes. **Innate affixes are restricted to the common rarity affixes, reflecting their simpler construction.**

Once you’ve Crafted your item, you can Enchant it. **You can use any rarity of affix as an enchantment,** allowing you to access stranger and more complex effects, such as a weapon that changes forms as you attack with it or armor that lets you blend perfectly into the shadows.
