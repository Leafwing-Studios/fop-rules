# Quirks

Every piece of gear has a particular **quirk** to it: something simple and distinctive about it. Quirks should give items memorable flavor and might occasionally be relevant outside of combat, similar in utility to a piece of adventuring gear.

Which quirks an item might have is determined by the fashion in which it was created. In game terms, this is the skill used to create or enchant it.

At any point, a player may choose to **discover** the quirk of an item. Quirks define an item’s identity: once discovered, a quirk is fixed in place and cannot be changed by any means. When you want to discover the quirk of an item, use the table below and either select a Craftsmanship quirk of your choice, or 4 quirks corresponding to the enchanting skill of the item: one of Anima, Arcana, Fontcraft or Tinkering. Then, roll a d4 to determine which quirk the unpredictable magic gave to your item.

Feel free to design new quirks to fit your item’s story or concept! However, combat-relevant effects should be reserved exclusively for affixes in order to preserve game balance.
