Your foeâ€™s worst terrors become vivid hallucinations as they enter the darkness, cursed to believe that they are real. For the duration of this effect, whenever the affected creature is in an area of darkness, they perceive a hallucinatory scene of your choice that is no larger than a 20-foot cube which only the target can see, hear or sense in any fashion. This hallucination must be restricted to areas of darkness.

The creature affected can use the Scan minor action to examine the hallucination, making a Focus (Insight) check contested by your Expertise (Arcana) skill. If the check succeeds, the target temporarily realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and are immune to its effects until the start of their next turn. Once they have recognized the illusion at least once, they have advantage on this skill check for the duration of this effect.

While affected, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. Anything unusual or illogical that occurs is rationalized away, although they may make a new contested skill check as a result of the new information.
