A bubbling wellspring of sacred water appears, gently but steadily flowing. Create the _cleansing spring_ tile effect in a 1 tile radius within range. Whenever a creature triggers the _cleansing spring_ tile effect, you gain the benefit of the Treat minor action targeting them. This is not optional, and you do not have disadvantage on Treat checks made in this way targeting yourself.

While your concentration holds, whenever you successfully use the Treat minor action, the creatures treated ignores new stacks of afflictions or ailments applied until the end of their next turn.

The Recover and Treat downtime activities restore an additional stack of exhaustion when performed in the vicinity of this spring.

### Portent of Winter - Miracle

<div class="tight">

**Action:** Major action

**Cost:** 0 essence

**Range:** 24 tiles

**Targets:** Multi-target

**Attack:** Prowess

**Duration:** Concentration

</div>

Nothing occurs when you first cast this miracle, although the air begins to chill and those nearby get a strange but certain sense that winter is coming. Select a tile within range. Unlike with other miracles, you cannot voluntarily choose to end your concentration on this miracle, and nothing you or your allies willingly do can break your concentration or end this effect.

While you are concentrating on this miracle, your favor continues to build up as you wait for the foreseen events to occur. The first time your favor is 5 or more at the start of your turn, this portent comes to pass. At that time, your concentration on this miracle ends and a terrible chill falls over the battlefield.

A 24 tile radius surrounding you gains the _terrible winter_ tile effect. Tiles affected are:

- heavily shrouded by blowing snow
- when triggered, applies 2 stacks of chilled, and then deals 1d6 + Presence water damage for each stack of chilled that the creature has
- applies disadvantage on Treat skill checks made to remove the chilled ailment

At the same time, create a _comforting warmth_ tile effect in a 2 tile radius, centered around a tile of your choice within 12 tiles. The _comforting warmth_ tile effect's only impact is to negate the _terrible winter_ tile effect.

Unlike with other miracles, you cannot voluntarily choose to end your concentration on this miracle, and nothing you or your allies willingly do can break your concentration or end this effect. You cannot attempt to Pray to cast other miracles while you are concentrating on this effect. This effect ends after your party completes a rest.

Waves crash and roar, flooding in and out as they wash all away. When you cast this miracle, choose whether to begin in the ebb state or the flow state. This is apparent to all creatures on the battlefield. Then, at the start of each of your turns for the duration of this effect:

- Swap ebb / flow states. If you were in ebb, you enter flow. If you were in flow, you enter ebb.
- Make a Prowess attack against all other creatures within range who are not flying or aloft.
- If you hit, deal 1d6 + Presence water damage, knock the creatures hit prone and apply forced movement. If you are in ebb, pull all creatures hit 3 tiles towards you. If you are in flow, push all creatures hit 3 tiles towards you.
- Creatures that you miss still suffer the attack's effects at half efficacy.
