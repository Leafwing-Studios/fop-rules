Unlike with other miracles, you cannot voluntarily choose to end your concentration on this miracle, and nothing you or your allies willingly do can break your concentration or end this effect.

While you are concentrating on this miracle, your favor continues to build up as you wait for the foreseen events to occur. The first time your favor is 5 or more at the start of your turn, this portent comes to pass. At that time, your concentration on this miracle ends and a terrible chill falls over the battlefield.

A 24 tile radius surrounding you gains the _terrible winter_ tile effect. Tiles affected are:

- heavily shrouded by blowing snow
- when triggered, applies 2 stacks of chilled, and then deals 1d6 + Presence water damage for each stack of chilled that the creature has
- applies disadvantage on Treat skill checks made to remove the chilled ailment

At the same time, create a _comforting warmth_ tile effect in a 2 tile radius, centered around a tile of your choice within 12 tiles. The _comforting warmth_ tile effect's only impact is to negate the _terrible winter_ tile effect.

Unlike with other miracles, you cannot voluntarily choose to end your concentration on this miracle, and nothing you or your allies willingly do can break your concentration or end this effect. You cannot attempt to Pray to cast other miracles while you are concentrating on this effect. This effect ends after your party completes a rest.
