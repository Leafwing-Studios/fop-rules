# Manifestations

## Blade

When you use the Swap minor action, you may summon a blade of swirling elements to your hand. These weapons (which can take any form you wish) are powered by your innate energy, granting you additional power but fading shortly after they leave your grasp.

When you learn this manifestation, create a set of arms using the standard rules. You are always attuned to these arms, and they do not count against your attunement limit. You may change these arms when you level up as one of the two choices you may modify, but cannot alter them using the Craft downtime activity.

These arms always have the _elemental weaponry_ affix corresponding to the element associated with your domain, changing the type of damage that they deal.

When you use the Strike major action (including as an attack of opportunity), you can Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** These arms gain additional affixes that persist until the sooner of a) the next time you make a basic attack or b) the start of your next turn c) you unequip these arms.

## Blast

You hurl a blast of elements at your foe. As a major action, make an Agility attack with this Manifestation against all creatures within a radius of a tile you select within 12 tiles, dealing elemental damage and inflicting a minor additional effect on hit based on your Domain.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The radius of the blast increases.
- **Even:** The blasts deal additional damage.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Blast manifestation, you may cause its path to bend and twist before it explodes. You no longer need to have a clear line of sight to the point at which it detonates, although it must be in range and the explosion itself is still affected by cover.

## Breath

The elements sweep across the battlefield, carrying with them everything in their path.

As a minor action, select a direction and a central tile within a range of 6 tiles. Make a Shove attack against all creatures in a radius around the central tile, pushing them back 1 tile in the direction you selected if you hit. You repeat this pattern a number of times, selecting a new direction and using the tile adjacent to the central tile in the specified direction as the new central tile.

The new direction must be the same as or adjacent to the previous direction selected. For example, if you were using a square grid and had selected north as your original direction, the next direction selected must be north-west, north or north-east.

You may change these arms when you level up as one of the two choices you may modify, but cannot alter them using the Craft downtime activity.

These arms always have the _grasping_ affix, which makes you unable to make basic attacks with them but grants you an automatic Expose attack after you hit a creature with a Grapple attack.
