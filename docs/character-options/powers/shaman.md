# Manifestations

## Blade

When you use the Swap minor action, you may summon a blade of swirling elements to your hand. These weapons (which can take any form you wish) are powered by your innate energy, granting you additional power but fading shortly after they leave your grasp.

When you learn this manifestation, create a set of arms using the standard rules. You are always attuned to these arms, and they do not count against your attunement limit. You may change these arms when you level up as one of the two choices you may modify, but cannot alter them using the Craft downtime activity.

These arms always have the _elemental weaponry_ affix corresponding to the element associated with your domain, changing the type of damage that they deal.

When you use the Strike major action (including as an attack of opportunity), you can Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** These arms gain additional affixes that persist until the sooner of a) the next time you make a basic attack or b) the start of your next turn or c) you unequip these arms.
- **Even:** The next basic attack with these arms deal additional damage if it hits.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** Your arms created by the Blade manifestation have the **shifting** affix. This affix allows you to select two forms for the arms created, which you may choose between whenever you use the Swap minor action. When you use the Attune downtime activity you may change their form completely, replacing their innate affixes with new ones.

| Surge | Additional Affixes |  Additional Damage  |
| :---: | :----------------: | :-----------------: |
|   0   |         0          |          0          |
|   1   |         1          |          0          |
|   2   |         1          |   1d8 + Presence    |
|   3   |         2          |   1d8 + Presence    |
|   4   |         2          | 2d8 + 2 \* Presence |
|   5   |         3          | 2d8 + 2 \* Presence |
|   6   |         3          | 3d8 + 3 \* Presence |
|   7   |         4          | 3d8 + 3 \* Presence |
|   8   |         4          | 4d8 + 4 \* Presence |
|   9   |         5          | 4d8 + 4 \* Presence |
|  10   |         5          | 5d8 + 5 \* Presence |
|  11   |         6          | 5d8 + 5 \* Presence |
|  12   |         6          | 6d8 + 6 \* Presence |

## Blast

You hurl a blast of elements at your foe. As a major action, make an Agility attack with this Manifestation against all creatures within a radius of a tile you select within 12 tiles, dealing elemental damage and inflicting a minor additional effect on hit based on your Domain. Creatures that you miss still suffer the attack's effect at half efficacy.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The radius of the blast increases. When the radius of the blast is "0 tiles", it only hits creatures in a single tile.
- **Even:** The damage of the blast increases.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Blast manifestation, you may cause its path to bend and twist before it explodes. You no longer need to have a clear line of sight to the point at which it detonates, although it must be in range and the explosion itself is still affected by cover.

| Surge | Radius |       Damage        |
| :---: | :----: | :-----------------: |
|   0   |   0    |   1d6 + Presence    |
|   1   |   1    |   1d6 + Presence    |
|   2   |   1    | 2d6 + 2 \* Presence |
|   3   |   2    | 2d6 + 2 \* Presence |
|   4   |   2    | 3d6 + 3 \* Presence |
|   5   |   3    | 3d6 + 3 \* Presence |
|   6   |   3    | 4d6 + 4 \* Presence |
|   7   |   4    | 4d6 + 4 \* Presence |
|   8   |   4    | 5d6 + 5 \* Presence |
|   9   |   5    | 5d6 + 6 \* Presence |
|  10   |   5    | 6d6 + 6 \* Presence |
|  11   |   6    | 6d6 + 6 \* Presence |
|  12   |   6    | 7d6 + 6 \* Presence |

## Breath

The elements sweep across the battlefield, carrying with them everything in their path.

As a minor action, select a direction and a central tile within a range of 6 tiles. Make a Shove attack against all creatures in a radius around the central tile, pushing them back 1 tile in the direction you selected if you hit. You repeat this pattern a number of times, selecting a new direction and using the tile adjacent to the central tile in the specified direction as the new central tile.

The new direction must be the same as or adjacent to the previous direction selected. For example, if you were using a square grid and had selected north as your original direction, the next direction selected must be north-west, north or north-east.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The radius of the pushing effect increases.
- **Even:** You may Shove an additional time.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Breath manifestation, you can choose its new direction freely.

| Surge | Radius | Shoves |
| :---: | :----: | :----: |
|   0   |   0    |   1    |
|   1   |   1    |   1    |
|   2   |   1    |   2    |
|   3   |   2    |   2    |
|   4   |   2    |   3    |
|   5   |   3    |   3    |
|   6   |   3    |   4    |
|   7   |   4    |   4    |
|   8   |   4    |   5    |
|   9   |   5    |   5    |
|  10   |   5    |   6    |
|  11   |   6    |   6    |
|  12   |   6    |   7    |

## Expel

By destabilizing existing ailments in a creature’s body, you can transmute them into an intense burst of elemental energy, curing your target even as you blast everything around them.

As a minor action, select a creature of your choice within 6 tiles of you. Gain the benefit of the Treat minor action targeting them. If you successfully remove ailments or afflictions from them, make a Prowess attack against all creatures within a radius around them, including the creature you treated. If you hit, deal 1 elemental damage for each stack removed, up to the maximum damage listed in the table below. Creatures that you miss still suffer the attack's effects at half efficacy.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The radius of the damage increases.
- **Even:** The maximum damage dealt increases.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Expel manifestation, you may shift your target once before they explode.

| Surge | Radius | Max Damage |
| :---: | :----: | :--------: |
|   0   |   1    |     5      |
|   1   |   2    |     5      |
|   2   |   2    |     10     |
|   3   |   3    |     10     |
|   4   |   3    |     15     |
|   5   |   4    |     15     |
|   6   |   4    |     20     |
|   7   |   5    |     20     |
|   8   |   5    |     25     |
|   9   |   6    |     25     |
|  10   |   6    |     30     |
|  11   |   7    |     30     |
|  12   |   7    |     35     |

## Grasp

Elements grasp at your foe, holding them tight as they crush them with raw force. When you use the Swap minor action, you may augment your grasp with terrible elemental energy.

When you learn this manifestation, create a set of arms using the standard rules. You are always attuned to these arms, and they do not count against your attunement limit. You may change these arms when you level up as one of the two choices you may modify, but cannot alter them using the Craft downtime activity.

These arms always have the _grasping_ affix, which makes you unable to make basic attacks with them but grants you an automatic Expose attack after you hit a creature with a Grapple attack.

When you use the Grapple major action (including as an attack of opportunity), you can Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** These arms gain additional affixes that persist until the sooner of a) the start of your next turn or b) you unequip these arms.
- **Even:** These arms deal additional elemental damage at the end of each of your turns to each creature that you are grappling.

| Surge | Additional Affixes |  Additional Damage  |
| :---: | :----------------: | :-----------------: |
|   0   |         0          |          0          |
|   1   |         1          |          0          |
|   2   |         1          |   1d8 + Presence    |
|   3   |         2          |   1d8 + Presence    |
|   4   |         2          | 2d8 + 2 \* Presence |
|   5   |         3          | 2d8 + 2 \* Presence |
|   6   |         3          | 3d8 + 3 \* Presence |
|   7   |         4          | 3d8 + 3 \* Presence |
|   8   |         4          | 4d8 + 4 \* Presence |
|   9   |         5          | 4d8 + 4 \* Presence |
|  10   |         5          | 5d8 + 5 \* Presence |
|  11   |         6          | 5d8 + 5 \* Presence |
|  12   |         6          | 6d8 + 6 \* Presence |

**Characteristic Manifestation:** The arms created by your Grasp manifestation have the _grasping appendages_ affix, which allows you to grapple any number of creatures at once.

## Meteor

Engulfed in a blaze of elemental energy, you blast through your foes, exploding in a catastrophic burst if you collide with a solid object.

As a major action:

- Launch forward a fixed distance in a straight line.
- You are treated as if you were flying during this movement.
- This does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
- Make an Agility attack against all creatures in your path.
- If you hit, deal elemental damage to them as shown in the table below.
- Hit or miss, they are knocked out of your way into the nearest empty tile of their choice that is not along your path.
- Creatures at the start of your path choose a new position before creatures towards the end of your path.
- If your movement is stopped before you reach the end of the distance (such as if you hit a wall), an elemental shockwave emanates from you.
  - Make an Agility attack against all creatures within a radius of the point where you collided, including yourself.
  - If you hit, they take elemental damage as listed in the table below.
  - If you miss, they suffer the attack's effects at half efficacy.

After you use the Meteor manifestation, you cannot spend movement until the start of your next turn.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The distance traveled and explosion radius increase.
- **Even:** The damage dealt by both the pass-through and the explosion increases.

| Surge | Explosion Radius | Flight Distance |       Damage        |
| :---: | :--------------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: |
|   0   |        1         |        2        |   1d4 + Presence    |

|  12   |        7         |       14        | 7d4 + 7 \* Presence |

## Roots

Planting yourself solidly in place, you channel the elemental energy of the land, bolstering your defenses as the air around you crackles with power.

If you have not yet spent movement this turn, you may use the Roots manifestation as a minor action. When you do:

- Until the start of your next turn, a 2 tile radius around you gains the _crackling power_ tile effect.
  - Make a Prowess attack against creatures who trigger your _crackling power_ tile effect. If you hit, apply stacks of the ailment specified by your Domain.
- Until the start of your next turn, you cannot spend movement and are immune to forced movement.
- At higher surge tiers, you also gain absorption.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The number of stacks of the ailment applied increases.
- **Even:** You gain increasing absorption when you use this manifestation.

- **Characteristic Manifestation:** Each time you use your _roots_ manifestation, you may choose which ailment is applied.

| Surge | Ailment Stacks | Absorption Gained  |
| :---: | :------------: | :----------------: |
|   0   |       1        |         0          |
|   1   |       2        |         0          |
|   2   |       2        |    6 + Presence    |
|   3   |       3        |    6 + Presence    |
|   4   |       3        | 12 + 2 \* Presence |

|  12   |       7        | 36 + 6 \* Presence |

## Shaping

The elements coat the ground or form a barrier, shaping the battlefield to your advantage.
You may use this Manifestation as a minor action with a range of 12 tiles.
Your Shaping manifestation creates a tile effect as described by your Domain. The tiles that you modify with each use of this manifestation must always be connected, although separate uses of it need not be.

After you create new tile effects, roll a d20 to see if the Shaping manifestation is triggered.
If the result is at least the triggering threshold, a special effect occurs on all tiles covered by your Shaping manifestation as described by your domain.
As a party, you may spend a Resolve to modify the outcome of this triggering roll.

You may have any number of tiles affected by your Shaping manifestation. It persists as long as you maintain your concentration but if you lose your concentration during this time, the effect immediately ends. You may also choose to end this effect for all affected tiles at the end of each of your turns.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The number of tiles affected increases.
- **Even:** The triggering threshold decreases.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Shaping manifestation, roll twice to determine whether it is triggered, and choose the roll you prefer.

| Surge | Affected Tiles | Triggering Threshold |
| :---: | :------------: | :------------------: |
|   0   |       3        |          15          |
|   1   |       6        |          15          |
|   2   |       6        |          13          |
|   3   |       9        |          13          |
|   4   |       9        |          11          |
|   5   |       12       |          11          |
|   6   |       12       |          9           |
|   7   |       15       |          9           |
|   8   |       15       |          7           |
|   9   |       18       |          7           |
|  10   |       18       |          5           |
|  11   |       21       |          5           |
|  12   |       21       |          3           |

## Shelter

As a reaction whenever a creature within 6 tiles of you would take elemental damage you may use the Shelter manifestation to imbue them with strength, protecting them from nature’s uncontrollable fury. When you do:

- They gain resistance to the type of elemental damage associated with your Domain until the start of your next turn.
- They gain absorption, listed in the table below.
- At higher surge tiers, you may also shift the affected creature. This occurs after the triggering effect completes.

When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** Shift the affected creature an increasing number of times.
- **Even:** The amount of absorption granted increases.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** You may also use your Shelter manifestation as a major action.

| Surge | Shifts | Absorption Gained  |
| :---: | :----: | :----------------: |
|   0   |   0    |    6 + Presence    |
|   1   |   1    |    6 + Presence    |

|  11   |   6    | 42 + 7 \* Presence |
|  12   |   6    | 42 + 7 \* Presence |

## Shield

Block blows with a swirling elemental shield, allowing you to absorb elemental damage, transforming it into an explosive cone of your own energy.
When you use the Block reaction, this manifestation activates:

- Until the start of your next turn, whenever your Block reaction would absorb damage until the start of your next turn, absorb additional elemental damage.
- When you absorb elemental damage int his way, deal the same amount of elemental damage, but of the type specified by your domain, to all creatures in a 2 tile cone, directed towards the source of the damage.
- Your Block reaction now persists until just after your Surge class feature deals damage to you, rather than ending just before like usual.

If you took elemental damage from a tile effect or your Surge class feature, you may choose to direct the cone in the direction of your choice.
When you Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** The radius of the cone increases.
- **Even:** The additional elemental damage absorbed increases.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** You may now use your Block reaction to prevent damage that would be taken by any creature within 2 tiles of you. Like always, you may empower this Block reaction with your _shield_ manifestation; the lingering effects apply to the creature that you blocked for.

| Surge | Cone Radius | Elemental Damage Absorbed |
| :---: | :---------: | :-----------------------: |
|   0   |      2      |      1d4 + Presence       |
|   1   |      3      |      1d4 + Presence       |
|   2   |      3      |    2d4 + 2 \* Presence    |
|   3   |      4      |    2d4 + 2 \* Presence    |
|   4   |      4      |    3d4 + 3 \* Presence    |
|   5   |      5      |    3d4 + 3 \* Presence    |
|   6   |      5      |    4d4 + 4 \* Presence    |
|   7   |      6      |    4d4 + 4 \* Presence    |
|   8   |      6      |    5d4 + 5 \* Presence    |
|   9   |      7      |    5d4 + 5 \* Presence    |
|  10   |      7      |    6d4 + 6 \* Presence    |
|  11   |      8      |    6d4 + 6 \* Presence    |
|  12   |      8      |    7d4 + 7 \* Presence    |

## Storm

As a major action, you cause the elements rain fury down upon an area.
Create an elemental storm tile effect with a 1 tile radius centered a point that you have line of sight to within 12 tiles.
This tile effect always deals elemental damage with an Agility attack, but also has an additional effect based on your Domain.
If you miss, the target suffers the attack's effects at half efficacy.

You may only have one Storm manifestation active at once; using this ability again ends the previous effect. It persists as long as you maintain your concentration but if you lose your concentration during this time, the effect immediately ends. You may also choose to end this effect at the end of each of your turns.

While you have a Storm active, you may spend a minor action to move it the distance specified in the table below.

When you summon this storm with a major action, or use a minor action to summon it, you may Surge this manifestation:

- **Odd:** When you use a major action to use this manifestation, its radius increases until the end of your next turn. When you use a minor action, you may move the storm a further distance.
- **Even:** The damage dealt by your elemental storm tile effect increases until the end of your next turn.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** At the end of each of your turns, you may move your active storm manifestation by up to 3 tiles.

| Surge | Storm Radius | Storm Movement | Elemental Storm Damage |
