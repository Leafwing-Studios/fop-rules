# Shaman
**Source of Power:** Drawing magical power from the land itself, Shamans manifest these primal energies with uncontrolled destructive force.

**Core Mechanic:** While Shamans are capable of spending essence at an unparalleled rate to empower their flexible manifestations, they risk being overloaded with elemental energy in return, suffering intense, unpredictable elemental damage whenever they exceed their capacity.

**Specialization:** Each Shaman is affiliated with a particular Domain: a component of the natural environment that determines the type of elemental damage that they deal, along with the details of their manifestations.

**Approach to Exploration:** Shamansâ€™ connection to nature gives them the ability to speak to the wildlife, plants and eventually even land around them. By tapping into the earth itself, they also gain the power to map their surroundings at a distance, making them exceptionally useful when exploring dangerous new places.

**Build Fundamentals:** With the help of their incredibly versatile manifestations, shamans can just as easily be powerful strikers hurling raw elemental force, subtle controllers of the battlefield, or ally-warding guardians:
* Striker: Focus on either the *blade* or *blast* manifestation to ensure you can put out consistent damage, then lay down a *storm* to funnel your enemies exactly where you want them.
* Controller: The *shaping* and *breath* manifestations are your best friends, especially when combined with either the *grasp* or *word* manifestations, letting you choke out your enemies options and control the whole battlefield from a distance.
* Guardian: Try to pick up the *expel* and *shelter* manifestations to support your allies and protect them from your wrath. Selecting *shield* as your characteristic manifestation is another great choice, letting you block blows for your allies.
