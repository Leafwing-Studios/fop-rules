# Incarnation
**Source of Power:** Wellsprings of raw emotion, Incarnations focus their feelings to become somehow larger than life.

**Core Mechanic:** As Incarnations bide their time in combat, their Emotion grows, which can be to grant them additional major actions in a turn. Spending essence to Transform,, they gain tremendous, straightforward power, but their Emotion slowly ticks down, until they return to their normal form and it begins to grow again.

**Specialization:** Each Incarnation specializes in a particular emotion, which dictates the mechanics of both the offensive and defensive components of their transformation.

**Approach to Exploration:** Incarnations excel at pushing directly through hardship, and can gain stacks of exhaustion to practically guarantee success on tasks they attempt.

**Build Fundamentals:** Incarnations can serve as both strikers and controllers, depending on their choice of subclass and gear:
* Striker: Ambition and Rage Incarnations can put out tons of damage, amplifying their basic attacksâ€™ power through critical strikes with affixes like *keen* and *brutal victory*. Rely on superior mobility or ranged attacks to stay safe, or simply tank through the pain with affixes like undying.
* Controller: Courage and Desire Incarnations are particularly adept at this role, taunting or charming your enemies. Augment this strength with weapons that apply conditions using the *imbued strikes* affix or focus on grappling with affixes like *grasping reach*.
