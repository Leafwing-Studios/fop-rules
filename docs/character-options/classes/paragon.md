# Paragon
**Source of Power:** Singularly committed to their ideals, the strength of the Paragon’s conviction shines through for everyone around them to see, and gives them the strength to stand proud in the face of overwhelming adversity.

**Core Mechanic:** Paragons prime auras: powerful persistent powers that affect either allies or enemies that are near them. These auras activate as the Paragon leads by example, landing blows in the heart of the battle.

**Specialization:** Each Paragon is committed to an ideal, which flavors their non-aura powers; giving them a benefit when they stand without moving and enhancing their Strike and Grapple major actions.

**Approach to Exploration:** Paragons excel at convincing others of their ideals’ merits and eventually gain access to the Sanctify downtime activity, marking an area as completely safe, setting the stage for negotiation.

**Build Fundamentals:** Paragons can be built for either a controller or guardian role, depending on how they prefer to position in a fight:
* Controller: Hold your ground in the middle of the enemy’s line and select auras that affect your enemies and focus on keeping yourself alive. Grappling can be a great addition, letting you force enemies to stay in range of your auras.
* Guardian: Plant your feet just in front of your backline, keeping your enemies from getting close to your allies as you enhance their effectiveness with your auras. Make sure they’re adjacent to you, so that you can use your incredibly powerful Block reaction to protect them should they get hit.
