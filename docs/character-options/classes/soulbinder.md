# Soulbinder
**Source of Power:** Forming a connection between their own soul and another through physical contact, Soulbinders manipulate this bond to transmit strange pulses to and from their dual.

**Core Mechanic:** After landing a basic attack (or using the Treat minor action on an ally), Soulbinders mark their target as their dual. So long as their concentration holds, they can use Pulses which affect one creature or the other (and eventually both), specializing in manipulating afflictions, conditions and absorption.

**Specialization:** Each Soulbinder’s connection has a distinctive Qualia: influencing how it feels, and granting the Soulbinder access to a unique pulse, a specialized downtime activity and powerful playstyle-defining combat features at higher levels.

**Approach to Exploration:** Soulbinders make for excellent spies, scouts and assassins: gaining access to features that improve their ability to manipulate their duals, while several of their pulses enhance their stealth capabilities.

**Build Fundamentals:** Soulbinders can be built to be insidious controllers, dedicated guardians or even assassin-esque strikers:S
* Controller: Focus on completely locking down a single target with conditions and afflictions and mitigate their effects on yourself with armor affixes like *conditional immunity*. The *imbued strikes* and *cruel strikes* affixes are very useful to allow your basic attacks to generate more stacks.
* Guardian: Specialize in protecting and empowering a single ally with absorption and subtly supportive effects. Damageless ranged weapons (created by stacking the *defensive* affix twice) can be a great option for quickly swapping targets when they’re outside the range of your Treat minor action.
* Striker: The soul burst pulse will be your bread and butter, encouraging you to blend your pulses with your enhanced basic attacks. Isolate a single target and then focus them down relentlessly, selecting pulses that remove their ability to defend themselves or rejoin the group.
