# Ascendant
**Source of Power:** Driven by relentless self-improvement, Ascendants hone their body into the perfect weapon, powered purely by their force of will and intense training (or strange experiments).

**Core Mechanic:** Ascendants chain their attacks together using their Combination Strikes feature, gaining the ability to make a new Strike, Grapple, Shove or Expose attack after landing their last one. In the face of danger, Ascendants calmly meditate, healing and dodging attacks as they take the Defend major action.

**Specialization:** Every Ascendantâ€™s body adapts in a unique fashion, giving them access to a remarkable number of affixes of their choice via the Natural Offense, Natural Defense and Self-Improvement class features to support truly unique build choices.

**Approach to Exploration:** Carefully reflecting, Ascendants gain access to the powerful Meditate downtime activity, which allows them to earn a Resolve for their party with a Focus (Insight) skill check. At higher levels, ascendants use their adapted body to the fullest, mastering Athletics, Perception and eventually even death itself.

**Build Fundamentals:** Ascendants naturally fill the control and striker roles:
* Striker: keep yourself safe through superior mobility with affixes like ineffable or flying, and then build to empower your basic attacks to deal damage with a flurry of blows.
* Controller: apply conditions with your basic attacks using the imbued strikes affix, or focus on grappling. prioritizing the grasping appendages affix to make sure you can lock down more than one creature at once.
