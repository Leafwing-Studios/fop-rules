# Ascendant
**Source of Power:** Driven by relentless self-improvement, Ascendants hone their body into the perfect weapon, powered purely by their force of will and intense training (or strange experiments).

**Core Mechanic:** Ascendants chain their attacks together using their Combination Strikes feature, gaining the ability to make a new Strike, Grapple, Shove or Expose attack after landing their last one. In the face of danger, Ascendants calmly meditate, healing and dodging attacks as they take the Defend major action.

**Specialization:** Every Ascendant’s body adapts in a unique fashion, giving them access to a remarkable number of affixes of their choice via the Natural Offense, Natural Defense and Self-Improvement class features to support truly unique build choices.

**Approach to Exploration:** Carefully reflecting, Ascendants gain access to the powerful Meditate downtime activity, which allows them to earn a Resolve for their party with a Focus (Insight) skill check. At higher levels, ascendants use their adapted body to the fullest, mastering Athletics, Perception and eventually even death itself.

**Build Fundamentals:** Ascendants naturally fill the control and striker roles:
* Striker: keep yourself safe through superior mobility with affixes like ineffable or flying, and then build to empower your basic attacks to deal damage with a flurry of blows.
* Controller: apply conditions with your basic attacks using the imbued strikes affix, or focus on grappling. prioritizing the grasping appendages affix to make sure you can lock down more than one creature at once.

## Combination Strikes
In battle, the Ascendant is an unstoppable martial force, striking their enemy with a flurry of chained blows from the improved body they have created. At level 1, whenever you hit a creature with an attack, you may spend one essence to immediately make another Strike, Grapple, Shove or Expose attack against them. At level 1, you may only use this feature once per round. The number of times per round that you can use this feature increases by one at levels 5, 9, 13 and 17.

Secondary attacks, such as those made due to the imbued strikes affix do not trigger this feature, although this feature can self-trigger, allowing for long chains of attacks as long as you keep hitting. If your attack targets multiple creatures, such as due to the sweeping affix, you must hit at least half of them, rounded up, in order to trigger this ability.

While you cannot usually spend essence while making attacks of opportunity, you can spend essence on Combination Strikes to follow up on attacks of opportunity that you land.

## Natural Offense
Each Ascendant customizes their body in unique ways, turning their body into a natural weapon. At level 1, the number of gear points that you can use for arms is now equal to your (Prowess + Presence) / 2, rather than simply your Prowess / 2. Any additional modifiers still apply.

When you gain this feature, select common affixes that sum to (Prowess + Presence) / 2 as if building a set of arms to create a natural weapon that you can use to attack with at any time. Your body changes to accommodate these modifiers a way that is consistent with the modifiers selected: mutating, transforming or granting you superhuman abilities to allow you to perform feats such as grabbing your opponents with your beastly jaws, striking at them with a long scorpion tale, shooting spikes at them out of your hands or tripping enemies with incredible speed.

These arms cannot have the *thrown* affix unless they also have the *returning* affix.

Whenever you make a basic attack, you may choose to use either your natural weapons or the set of arms that you are wielding, if any, without needing to use the Swap minor action. If you gain natural weapons in any other way, such as through the wild combat talent or as a species feature, build a second set of natural weapons that you may choose freely between each time you make a basic attack.

If your Prowess or Presence changes, you must reselect the affixes used in this feature to ensure their gear point total is correct.

## Meditation
When you reach level 2, you learn to sit in perfect tranquility, refreshing yourself even as battle rages around you. Whenever you take the Defend major action and have not yet spent movement or made an attack this turn, you may spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus to regain life equal to four times the essence spent. When you do, you cannot spend movement or make any attacks until the start of your next turn.

You also gain access to the Meditate downtime activity, seeking to learn an inner truth. Make a difficulty 15 Focus (Insight) skill check. If you succeed, the party gains a Resolve.

## Natural Defense
Also at level 2, you learn to shape your body for defensive purposes as well: gaining thick skin, a supernatural ability to shrug off blows or the like. The normal rules for setting your basic defense no longer apply to you, and can no longer gain the benefits of wearing other suits of armor:
Select affixes with a gear point total equal to your (Prowess + Presence) / 2 as if building a set of armor to create natural defenses that protect you at all times. 
Your basic defense is increased by 2, typically becoming 14 + Agility + the effects of any relevant affixes selected.

Your body changes to accommodate these affixes in a way that is consistent with the affixes selected. If your Prowess or Presence changes, you must reselect the affixes used in this feature to ensure their gear point total is correct.

## Self-Improvement
At level 3, you learn to augment your body with powerful magical abilities, gaining their effect at all times. Whenever you gain this feature, you may select non-prismatic arms or armor affixes that have an enchantment point total equal to the number associated with this feature. You gain their effects at all times as your body changes to incorporate their magic. These abilities do not count against the limit of enchantment points you may be attuned to as they are class features which mimic the effects of enchantments, rather than true enchantments.

The gear point total of these affixes must equal two at level 3, increasing to three at level 11.

## Tranquility
When you reach level 3, maintaining your tranquility in the face of danger only bolsters your spirit. Whenever you take the Defend major action, until the start of your next turn, regain 1 essence each time that a hostile creature misses you with an attack.

## Attribute Improvement
When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.


## Proficiency Bonus Improvement
At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Discipline
When you reach level 6, the results of your intense physical training (or strange improvements) are clearly visible. You have advantage on all Athletics skill checks that you make.

## Blur
At level 7, you fight with incredible speed, blurring your form and causing attacks to slide off of you. Each time you use your Combination Strikes feature, gain 1 absorption.

## Sublimation
Upon reaching level 10, you have transcended bodily needs. You no longer need to eat, drink or breathe and you recover from two levels of exhaustion every time you complete a rest.

## Awareness
When you reach level 14, you are always alert and aware of your surroundings.  You no longer need to sleep, but must still spend the same amount of time in quiet contemplation to gain the benefits of a rest. While contemplating you remain alert and can still make Perception skill checks like usual. You have advantage on all Perception skill checks that you make.

## Integrity
At level 15, your body forcibly rejects harmful influences as incongruent with your greater plan. You become proficient in all special defenses.

## Reincarnation
As a level 18 Ascendent, you never truly die, your soul entering back into the circle of life. While dead, you do not gain stacks of Transcendence. Others have advantage on all skill checks made to resurrect you.

## Ascension
When you reach level 20, you have achieved your ideal form: body and mind existing in perfect harmony. Whenever you successfully use the Meditate downtime activity, choose one of the following effects:
* There is no limit to the number of times that you may use your Combination Strikes feature per round but you may no longer take the Defend major action.
* At the start of each of your turns, remove one stack of each affliction and condition from yourself. When you use the Defend major action and take advantage of your Meditation class feature, gain 12 absorption.
* Your movement speed is doubled, attacks of opportunity against you have disadvantage and you may pass through enemy tiles.
* You have advantage on all special attacks. You may make Shove and Expose attacks using your Combination Strikes feature without spending any extra essence or counting against the total number of attacks used, although your chain still breaks if you miss them.

The chosen effect persists until it is replaced by another in this list.
