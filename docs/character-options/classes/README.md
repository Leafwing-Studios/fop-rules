**Classifying Playstyles**

By categorizing the patterns in which various classes (and characters) play in combat, we can describe their **playstyle** in a way that helps us think and communicate about how they work across several important axes. This classification is intended to act as a guide, not a prescription, helping you make quick and informed decisions during character building.

#### Approach

**Martial:** Uses traditional weaponry almost exclusively.

**Caster:** Uses magical spells almost exclusively.

**Spellblade:** Combines traditional weaponry and magic spells.

#### Position

**Frontline:** Take and land hits in melee.

**Backline:** Sling attacks from a safe distance.

**Skirmisher:** Highly mobile, moving in and out between different ranges as needed.

#### Role

**Striker:** Ensure that your opponents’ life hits 0 before your party’s does.

**Controller:** Limit your opponents’ actions by shaping the battlefield or impairing their effectiveness.

**Guardian:** Support your allies by protecting and enhancing them.

When a playstyle is listed in *italics*, opting into that classification will require more specific character choices.
