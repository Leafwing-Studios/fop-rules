# Classes
Every player character has a class: the source of their magical powers. As you level up, you will learn to master this power, gaining new class features and expanding your repertoire of powers. *The Playerâ€™s Guide to Fonts of Power* contains 12 classes, each with their own source of magic and unique playstyle. You can click the header names to go to the full description of that class.
