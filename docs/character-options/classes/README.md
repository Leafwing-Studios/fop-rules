# Classes
Every player character has a class: the source of their magical powers. As you level up, you will learn to master this power, gaining new **class features** and expanding your repertoire of **powers.**

A brief summary of the classes in the game is provided here. In addition to a description of the fantasy that drives each class, it includes the common roles and playstyles that those classes fill. It is important to note that many classes, by design, can be built or played in a variety of different ways. With some creativity, you could play almost any class in almost any role. However, some roles come very naturally to certain classes, and they can be a quick and easy way to find a class that fits the character you would like to play. 

Classes are categorized by the following schema: 

**Playstyle**

* **Caster:** Uses magical spells almost exclusively
* **Gish:** Uses a combination of traditional weaponry and magic
* **Martial:** Uses conventional weapons almost exclusively

**Position**

* **Backline:** Sling attacks from a safe distance.
* **Frontline:** Take and land hits in melee
* **Skirmisher:** Highly mobile, moving in and out between different ranges as needed

**Role**

* **Bruiser:** Draw attention by posing a threat, but make sure you can take what you’re dishing out.
* **Controller:** Block off options for your opponents by shaping the battlefield or impairing their effectiveness.
* **Guardian:** Support your allies by protecting and enhancing them.
* **Striker:** Reduce your opponents’ life, quickly.

Positions and roles listed in dark gray require more specific character choices to opt into. 

The Complexity column in the table below is designed to reflect the class’s skill floor: the initial challenge involved in becoming proficient with a particular class as a player that is new to *Fonts of Power.*
