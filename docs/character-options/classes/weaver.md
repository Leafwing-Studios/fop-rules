# Weaver
**Source of Power:** Carefully manipulating the threads of magic that underlie reality, Weavers are masters of the arcane, creating and destroying matter and warping time and space with deft hands and a quick mind.

**Core Mechanic:** Weavers work their magic through Patterns: simple, subtle spells that take effect at the end of the Weaver’s turn. While the Weaver’s concentration holds, these Patterns can be sustained at the cost of essence, allowing them to carefully manipulate the entire battlefield as they

**Specialization:** Each Weaver belongs to a Guild, which specializes in a particular discipline of the craft. This grants them access to specialized patterns, and allows them to shape reality itself during downtime.

**Approach to Exploration:** Weavers can see and read the threads of magic, a coveted skill in a world brimming with dangerous and tantalizing magical traps, items and phenomena. Their downtime activities gained through their Guild are both powerful and flexible, and tend to become central to the Weaver’s contribution to the party’s problem solving.

**Build Fundamentals:** Depending on their selection of patterns, weavers can serve as flexible and responsive strikers, controllers or guardians:
* Striker: select a damaging pattern that matches your playstyle and then amplify its effectiveness with your other patterns and gear. *Pattern of annihilation,* *pattern of animation,* and *pattern of destruction* all reward very different builds, making it more effective to specialize or swap arms when you swap patterns.
* Controller: pick up patterns that apply conditions or restrict space like *pattern of binding* or *pattern of forbiddance*. Prioritize locking down the enemies that are trying to break your concentration to make sure you can keep the situation under control.
* Guardian: select a blend of offensive (like *pattern of augmentation* and *pattern of empowerment*) and defensive (like *pattern of absorption* or *pattern of warding*) patterns, so you can adapt to the situation as it evolves. Absorption is an extremely effective defensive option as your concentration is only tested when you lose life, not when you take damage.
