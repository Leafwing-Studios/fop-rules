# Trickster
**Source of Power:** Masters of chance, Tricksters play the odds as they manipulate luck itself to pull off improbable shenanigans with alarming regularity.

**Core Mechanic:** Tricksters take every advantage they can get: slipping into invisibility, tossing out delayed-action explosive tricks and landing low blows as they roll, reroll and amplify their exploding dice.

**Specialization:** Befitting their stylish nature, every Trickster has a particular Flair to their fighting style. This Flair determines the nature of their Low Blows, and gives them access to unique abilities that help them get out of the trouble they seem to invariably get caught up in.

**Approach to Exploration:** Tricksters are the masters of the improbable, and use their skills to their fullest potential. When they Roll the Dice, Tricksters randomly determine an attribute to use with the skill they’ve selected, temporarily gaining proficiency as they carefully persuade locks to open, use their strength to enchant items with a single hammer blow or exploit their knowledge of biomechanics to clear chasms in a single bound,

**Build Fundamentals:** Tricksters can serve as both excellent strikers and controllers, depending on whether they focus on their tricks or basic attacks:
* Striker: Stack Prowess and Agility, focus on critical strikes and try to roll as high as you can. With your easy access to advantage, the *precise* affix is a staple; try to burst down vulnerable targets from the flanks as you pop out of invisibility.
* Controller: Focus on Expertise and Presence to make sure your endless supply of tricks have the optimal effect. Be mindful of their placement and try to lock down enemies in their effect (or deceive them about its nature): your tricks’ delayed activation and short range really rewards creativity.
