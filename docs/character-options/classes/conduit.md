# Conduit
**Source of Power:** Conduits collect and focus the ambient magic of their surroundings, carefully channeling this magic into items before releasing it in a surge of power. 

**Core Mechanic:** The spells that conduits cast can be directed into their weapons instead, imbuing their basic attacks with incredible magic that chains between their foes.

**Specialization:** Conduits learn to master specific enchantments, permanently gaining the effect of specific affixes as they level up.

**Approach to Exploration:** The Conduitâ€™s skill in temporarily imbuing items with magic transfers naturally to doing so permanently, lending them a distinct advantage during various downtime activities related to enchanting. 

**Build Fundamentals:** Whether they are shooting arrows of light at the enemy or wielding a flaming sword, Conduits make excellent strikers, with the option to focus more heavily on control if they so choose:

* Striker: Opt into the risky double-edged spells like roar of fire to maximize your output, then select armor affixes like *immunity* to mitigate their downsides.
* Controller: Double down on your conditions, selecting affixes like *imbued strikes* and *merciless* to apply more of them and then amplify their effects with exotic affixes like *absolute zero*.
