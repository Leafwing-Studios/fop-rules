# Runeseeker

**Source of Power:** MAGICAL SYMBOLS.

**Core Mechanic:** CAST SPELLS, MODIFY THEM.

**Specialization:** FOUR SCHOOLS, FOUR SKILLS, FOUR SPELL LISTS. AS YOU LEVEL UP, SELECT RUNIC ALTERATIONS TO TWEAK YOUR SPELLS.

**Approach to Adventure:** FIELD STUDY.

**Build Fundamentals:** Runeseekers make excellent strikers or powerful controllers, depending on their selection of spells and arms affixes:

- _Striker:_ Select spells that deal tons of damage, aiming for a diversity of effects and elemental damage types. Afflictions don't do damage immediately, but can be particularly effective in longer fights. _Effective thaumaturgy_ and _cruel thaumaturgy_ are excellent ways to increase the damage of your spells, or pick up _keen_ and _effervescent triumph_ to specialize in critical strikes.
- _Controller:_ Focus on spells that apply forced movement and ailments, prioritizing tools that synergize with your allies plans. _Imbued thaumaturgy_, _cantrip_ and _imbued conversion_ are great ways to get access to new ailments, while affixes with the "vantage" tag (like _fogcaller_) can help you shape the battlefield. _Distant thaumaturgy_ can be a great choice for staying safe in the backline, while _expansive thaumaturgy_ can help make sure you hit all of the important targets at once.
