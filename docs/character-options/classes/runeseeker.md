# Runeseeker

**Source of Power:** MAGICAL SYMBOLS.

**Core Mechanic:** CAST SPELLS, MODIFY THEM.

**Specialization:** FOUR SCHOOLS, FOUR SKILLS, FOUR SPELL LISTS. AS YOU LEVEL UP, SELECT RUNIC ALTERATIONS TO TWEAK YOUR SPELLS.

**Approach to Adventure:** FIELD STUDY.

**Build Fundamentals:** Runeseekers make excellent strikers or powerful controllers, depending on their selection of spells and arms affixes:

- _Striker:_ Select spells that deal tons of damage, aiming for a diversity of effects and elemental damage types. Afflictions don't do damage immediately, but can be particularly effective in longer fights. _Effective thaumaturgy_ and _cruel thaumaturgy_ are excellent ways to increase the damage of your spells, or pick up _keen_ and _effervescent triumph_ to specialize in critical strikes.
- _Controller:_ Focus on spells that apply forced movement and ailments, prioritizing tools that synergize with your allies plans. _Imbued thaumaturgy_, _cantrip_ and _imbued conversion_ are great ways to get access to new ailments, while affixes with the "vantage" tag (like _fogcaller_) can help you shape the battlefield. _Distant thaumaturgy_ can be a great choice for staying safe in the backline, while _expansive thaumaturgy_ can help make sure you hit all of the important targets at once.

## Runecasting

Runeseekers draw on the magic of knowledge, perfectly capturing the essence of a phenomenon as they trace the corresponding sigil in the air.

As a level 1 Runeseeker, you have access to the Cast major action, allowing you to cast diverse spells to blast away your foes or control the battlefield.

In their most basic form, Runeseeker spells always cost 1 essence, use a major action and make an attack against a single creature.
When you cast a spell, you may spend additional essence to empower its effects, up the maximum total essence shown in the table below.

| Level | Max Essence per Spell |
| :---: | :-------------------: |
|  1-4  |           1           |
|  5-8  |           2           |
| 9-12  |           3           |
| 13-16 |           4           |
| 17-20 |           5           |

At level 1, you know 4 spells, and learn a new spell at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. At least half of the spells that you know must be from the spell list associated with your school of magic; other spells can be chosen freely from other schools of magic.

## Schools of Magic

At level 1, each Runeseeker chooses a **school of magic**, specializing in a particular form of magic according to their unique training. This choice determines the primary spell list available to you.

Each school is associated with a particular **academic skill**. You are proficient in this skill (in addition to the five skill you select), and several of your features grant additional uses or bonuses to the academic skill associated with your choice of school.

## Elaborate Runes

While the runeseeker's spells are exceptionally powerful, they are more complicated to cast during combat than those of other classes. At level 1, choose one of the following drawbacks for your spells. Like with all choices made as part of your class (such as any Runic Alteration class feature or a spell you selected), you may change up to two of these choices each time you level up.

### Hurried Casting

Your spells are quick but inefficient. You have disadvantage on skill checks made to use the Essence Tap minor action.

### Risky Casting

Your spells are powerful but leave you open to counterattack as you focus intently on their completion. Whenever you cast a spell, provoke an attack of opportunity.

Like all attacks of opportunity, this attack of opportunity resolves before the triggering action (casting a spell in this case) is complete.

### Focused Casting

Your spells are perfectly executed but require your careful concentration to complete. After you cast a spell, its effects do not immediately complete.
Instead, the spell you cast takes effect at the start of your next turn, targeted at that time. You must hold your [concentration](../rules/combat/tactical-mechanics?id=concentration) during this time. If you fail a concentration check before the start of your next, the spell is lost.

## Secrets of the Past

At level 2, your studies give you a distinct edge when attempting to research, recall or discover facts about the past. You have advantage on skill checks that use Insight or your academic skill made to learn information about events that occurred in the past.

## Self-Reliance

Also at level 2, you are able to convert some of the essence that you draw upon into magical healing, allowing you to press on in pursuit of treasure and knowledge. After you use the Essence Tap minor action, you may spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus to restore life equal to eight times your proficiency bonus.

## Runic Alteration: Quantifier

At level 3, you unlock the first of many advanced techniques; combining the inscribed rune with a quantifier to allow it to affect many creatures at once. Learn one of the three following **alterations**. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose whether or not to apply each alteration that you know.

### Spherical Alteration

The altered spell becomes multi-target, hitting all creatures within a 2 tile radius around a tile selected within range. Halve the efficacy of spells altered in this way.

### Conical Alteration

The altered spell becomes multi-target, hitting all creatures within a 3 tile cone behind a tile selected within range. This cone always points directly away from the caster. Halve the efficacy of spells altered in this way.

### Spreading Alteration

When this alteration is applied, the spell becomes multi-target, hitting the 3 creatures nearest to a tile selected within range, up to a maximum range of 4 tiles from the targeted tile. In the event of a tie, the caster may choose which creatures to affect. Halve the efficacy of spells altered in this way.

## Rune Seeking

At level 6, you have begun to learn the art of runeseeking, granting you the ability to carefully scry for rare and powerful treasure that holds deep secrets. Gain access to the **Runeseek** downtime activity. When you use this downtime activity, make a Focus skill check using the academic skill associated with your school of magic.

Choose a nearby font of power, then choose one of the following options:

- **Breadth:** Uncover one treasure found in that font of power (that you have not previously uncovered) at random for every five points of your skill check result. The worldspeaker provides the name, short description and complete list of affixes for each uncovered treasure.
- **Depth:** Choose one treasure that you have previously uncovered, or one treasure that you currently possess. For every ten points of your skill check result, you may learn the answer to one question of your choice about that treasure. These questions must have clear, objective answers that rely only on the state of the world (either presently or in the past), and cannot rely on information about the internal mental state of creatures.

For example, you might ask:

- Who first created this treasure?
- Who is the current owner of that treasure?
- Where is this treasure currently?

But you could not ask:

- Why was this treasure created?
- What could this treasure be used for?
- Who holds this treasure dear to their heart?

## Runic Alteration: Accent

At level 7, you master your second technique; adding an accent to the inscribed rune that causes it to be more effective in some circumstances, but less in others.
Learn one of the three following **alterations**. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose whether or not to apply each alteration that you know.

### Pointblank Alteration

The altered spell becomes melee, with a range equal to the radius of your zone of control. As a result, you no longer have disadvantage on attacks made with this spell while in an enemy zone of control. When used in concert with an alteration from your Runic Alteration: Quantifier class feature, the area of effect is centered around you, rather than a tile of your choice within range (although you may choose the direction of any relevant effects).

### Swelling Alteration

You have disadvantage on attacks made with the altered spell against targets within half of the maximum range of the spell, and advantage on all other attacks made with the altered spell.

### Reckless Alteration

You have disadvantage on attacks made with the altered spell, but your critical hit threshold for attacks made with the altered spell is reduced by 3.

## Field Notes

At level 10, you learn to take full advantage of the unique academic opportunities provided by subjecting yourself to intense and unusual danger. Whenever you gain a Resolve, also gain the benefit of the Prepare downtime activity, focusing on the academic skill associated with your school of magic.

## Runic Alteration: Script

At level 11, you master your third technique; altering the script of the inscribed rune in a way that changes the fundamental components of the spell.
Learn one of the three following **alterations**. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose whether or not to apply each alteration that you know.

<div class="side-panel">

| **School**  | **Elements**              | **Ailments**                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ?Anima?     | primal, decay, air        | rooted, withered, aloft         |
| ?Arcana?    | arcane, eldritch, water   | banished, crazed, chilled       |
| ?Fontcraft? | radiant, umbral, earth    | pacified, cursed, blunted       |
| ?Tinkering? | electric, corrosion, fire | lethargic, defenseless, blinded |

</div>

### Colorful Alteration

Change the elemental damage type dealt by the altered spell to one of the three associated with your school of magic, shown in the table in the sidebar.

### Bold Alteration

Change all stacks of ailments applied by the altered spell to one of the three associated with your school of magic, shown in the table in the sidebar.

### Fundamental Alteration

Change the special attack type used by the altered spell to correspond to an attribute of your choice.

## Lore Seeking

At level 14, the power of your rune seeking magic grows, letting you learn much broader types of information. When you use the Rune Seeking downtime activity, you may choose to learn about characters or locations within the font of power instead. You may choose which type of entity you wish to learn about (treasure, character or location) after each entity is revealed for the Breadth option.

When you learn about a character during the Breadth option, you learn their name, basic appearance and loyalty towards any other creatures or factions that you know.

When you learn about a location during the Runeseek downtime activity, you learn its basic appearance (averaged over the past year), and any vantages that the arena may contain.

## Runic Alteration: Style

At level 15, you master your fourth and final technique; adding a unique twist to the runes that you inscribe that embodies the essential nature of your school of magic. Learn one of the three **alterations** described in the section for your school of magic, found at the end of this class description. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose whether or not to apply each alteration that you know.

## Allure of the Unknown

At level 18, the dangerous wilds and ruins of the world call to you, strengthening your resolve as you seek to uncover their deepest secrets. Whenever you complete a rest (other than by spending Resolve) in an area with a danger level of 1 or higher, gain a Resolve.

## Pinnacle of Knowledge

At level 20, you have reached the current pinnacle of knowledge of your magic, and begin to invent new techniques.

You gain access to the Scholarship downtime activity. When you use this downtime activity, you may replace one of your spells or alterations known (or the choice made for your Elaborate Runes class feature), replacing it with another choice from the same class feature.

In addition, you gain a powerful bonus to your spells, as described in the section for your school of magic, found at the end of this class description.
