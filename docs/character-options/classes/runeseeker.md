# Runeseeker

**Source of Power:** MAGICAL SYMBOLS.

**Core Mechanic:** CAST SPELLS, MODIFY THEM.

**Specialization:** FOUR SCHOOLS, FOUR SKILLS, FOUR SPELL LISTS. AS YOU LEVEL UP, SELECT RUNIC ALTERATIONS TO TWEAK YOUR SPELLS.

**Approach to Adventure:** FIELD STUDY.

**Build Fundamentals:** Runeseekers make excellent strikers or powerful controllers, depending on their selection of spells and arms affixes:

- _Striker:_ Select spells that deal tons of damage, aiming for a diversity of effects and elemental damage types. Afflictions don't do damage immediately, but can be particularly effective in longer fights. _Effective thaumaturgy_ and _cruel thaumaturgy_ are excellent ways to increase the damage of your spells, or pick up _keen_ and _effervescent triumph_ to specialize in critical strikes.
- _Controller:_ Focus on spells that apply forced movement and ailments, prioritizing tools that synergize with your allies plans. _Imbued thaumaturgy_, _cantrip_ and _imbued conversion_ are great ways to get access to new ailments, while affixes with the "vantage" tag (like _fogcaller_) can help you shape the battlefield. _Distant thaumaturgy_ can be a great choice for staying safe in the backline, while _expansive thaumaturgy_ can help make sure you hit all of the important targets at once.

## Runecasting

Runeseekers draw on the magic of knowledge, perfectly capturing the essence of a phenomenon as they trace the corresponding sigil in the air.

As a level 1 Runeseeker, you have access to the Cast major action, allowing you to cast diverse spells to blast away your foes or control the battlefield.

In their most basic form, Runeseeker spells always cost 1 essence, use a major action and make an attack against a single creature.
When you cast a spell, you may spend additional essence to empower its effects, up the maximum total essence shown in the table below.

| Level | Max Essence per Spell |
| :---: | :-------------------: |
|  1-4  |           1           |
|  5-8  |           2           |
| 9-12  |           3           |
| 13-16 |           4           |
| 17-20 |           5           |

At level 1, you know 4 spells, and learn a new spell at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. At least half of the spells that you know must be from the spell list associated with your school of magic; other spells can be chosen freely from other schools of magic.

## Schools of Magic

At level 1, each Runeseeker chooses a **school of magic**, specializing in a particular form of magic according to their unique training. This choice determines the primary spell list available to you.

### Runic Alteration: ?Weird?

At level 15, each Runeseeker gains access to a unique Runic Alteration that is specific to their school of magic, allowing them to alter their spells in strange and interesting ways. Select one of the three available runic alterations specified for your school of magic, listed at the end of this class description.
