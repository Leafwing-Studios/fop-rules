# Devout
**Source of Power:** Praying to a higher power, the Devout are offered a taste of unimaginable power, capable of working miracles so long as they please their fickle god.

**Core Mechanic:** The Devout’s miracles are incredibly powerful, persisting as long as their concentration holds, but pulling them off is no meager feat. Each turn that the Devout uses a prayer, their favor grows. This favor amplifies the effect of their bribes of essence, beginning a powerful miracle as they suddenly become the most important objective on the battlefield.  

**Specialization:** Each Devout worships a particular deity, distinguished both by its three elemental domains and the nature of its power, which determines the consequences of the Devout attempting and failing to invoke a miracle. 

**Approach to Exploration:** With diligent work, rituals offer the power of a miracle on demand, opening the door to creative problem solving through incredible power. By reading the vague signs left by their god, Devout are also capable of limited insight into the future with their Augury subclass feature,

**Build Fundamentals:** Depending on your selection of prayers, Devouts can serve as effective controllers, guardians or strikers:
* Controller: Neutralize your foes with the curse cycle of prayers or shape the battlefield with the genesis cycle, completely swinging the whole tide of battlefield when your miracles come through. With the party’s help, you can play a slow, defensive style and pull off an impossibly powerful *portent* miracle, creating stories that will never be forgotten. 
* Striker: Bide your time and set up for a huge wrath miracle that devastates the entire battlefield. By selecting the *avatar* cycle of prayers and prioritizing Prowess and Agility, you can become a powerful martial force to be reckoned with, putting an entirely different twist on the class.
* Guardian: Looks for prayers that grant boons to your allies, such as the *blessing* and *gift* cycles, then supercharge an ally with a miracle while you stay safe in the backline.
