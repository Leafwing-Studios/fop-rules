# Touched
**Source of Power:** Fused with the magic of another soul, the Touched must share a body and mind with an alien entity. Over time, the Host learns to draw on the Companion’s power and share their own, fighting together in a beautiful duet.

**Core Mechanic:** While the Host fights with classical weaponry, the Companion slings simple custom spells in unison. The range of the weapons and spells plays a critical role, and in order to use their power to its fullest the Touched must weave together attacks in both melee and at range each turn.

**Specialization:** Every Companion’s power is unique: granting access to custom spells and trinket affixes that correspond to the elements of its power.

**Approach to Exploration:** As the Touched learns to work together, the Host’s body slowly mutates, becoming more similar to that of their Companion and gaining permanent access to a large number of personalized trinket affixes that reflect their unique capabilities.

**Build Fundamentals:** Touched are natural skirmishers, dancing in and out of the fray of battle. They are most easily built as lightweight highly mobile strikers, but with enough disruption and survivability they can live in the frontline instead:
* Skirmisher: Make sure to have versatile options for both ranged and melee, in both your weapons and powers. The *swapping*, *wild* and *shifting* affixes are particularly useful for making this painless. Focus on mobility and avoiding attacks of opportunity with affixes like *deft* or *shifty* and try to make sure you end every turn out of the immediate fray.
* Frontline: Draw attention by diving deep into the backlines, then stick to your foes with attacks that limit mobility and the proactive combat talent. Back out when you drop low on health, and then heal back up with your Balance of Power: Host feature.
