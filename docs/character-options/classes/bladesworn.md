# Bladesworn
**Source of Power:** Irrevocably bound to a sentient weapon, Bladesworn draw on the accumulated knowledge and skill of its past wielders, slowly contributing bits of their own soul back into the collective.

**Core Mechanic:** As the Bladesworn land attacks, responding to the shifting battlefield with powerful counterattacks, they fall deeper and deeper into the Rhythm of battle, accepting their weapon’s power as their blows land with increasing impact. 

**Specialization:** Every weapon belongs to a proud Lineage: defining its reason for existence. This choice dictates how the Bladesworn’s Rhythm improves their attacks, eventually granting access to a unique counterattack and a powerful capstone that grants them unbelievable power while at 5 or more stacks of Rhythm.

**Approach to Exploration:** Drawing on the accumulated knowledge of the past wielders, Bladesworn make for exceptional jack-of-all-trades, improving the results of their skill checks in a way that surpasses their personal proficiency. 

**Build Fundamentals:** Bladesworn make natural strikers, but can opt into the control roles with the right choices:
* Striker: Both stacking up afflictions and dealing direct damage can be effective routes to whittle your enemies down. If you choose to use a ranged weapon, be sure to pick counterattacks that you can reliably trigger to make sure you’re rarely left with excess reactions.
* Control: The *reach* arms affix is your best friend, letting you control and respond to the battle more effectively. Carefully force your opponents to play around your counterattacks, augmented by affixes like *imbued strikes* and *catching* to increase the disabling power of every basic attack.

| Roll  | How did you encounter your weapon?                          |

|   1   | I stumbled across it.                                       |
|   2   | It’s been handed down in my family for generations.         |
|   3   | It was given to me by the last owner in their dying breath. |

|   3   | I am grateful for their knowledge and skill.            |
|   4   | I revere them in some way.                              |
|   5   | They are my closest friends.                            |
|   6   | I feel myself becoming one with their collective.       |

## Rhythm of Battle

Bladesworn dance through battle in a carefully coordinated flurry of steel and wood, relying as much on the instincts imparted by their blade as any skill or training they might have. At level 1, you learn to use **Rhythm**, increasing your power as you land attacks repeatedly.

In order to ensure that your attacks land reliably, **add half your Presence to both your basic attack and special attack modifiers.** If your Presence is odd, round down and then add 1 to your choice of basic attack or special attack modifier.

Rhythm grants you various bonuses, and changes in the following ways:

-   Each time you hit a creature with a basic attack or one of your counterattacks, your Rhythm goes up by 1. This occurs before your attack is resolved.
-   Whenever you miss with a basic attack or one of your counterattacks, your Rhythm is reset to 0.
-   If you end your turn without having made a basic attack, your Rhythm goes down by 1 (to a minimum of 0).
-   Your Rhythm is reset to 0 at the end of each combat.

If you make multiple attacks as part of the same action or reaction, only the first one counts for this feature. Your Rhythm does not increase multiple times and you only activate any triggered effects once.

## Counterattacks

At level 1, your blade seems to act with a mind of its own, tugging you toward weaknesses in your opponents’ technique. You learn to use **counterattacks,** special combat techniques that grant you the ability to react to unusual circumstances with elaborate tactical attacks.

These are attacks of opportunity with unique triggers and effects: they are made as a special attack but resolved as if you had struck with a weapon attack, and gain an additional effect if you hit. These use your weapon(s): they are melee if your weapon is melee and ranged if your weapon is ranged, and two-weapon fighting choices can be made as normal. Any effect which modifies basic attacks, or triggers upon landing a basic attack, such as arms affixes like snaring or knockback, also apply to counterattacks. Each counterattack costs 1 essence.

You learn 3 counterattacks at level 1, selected from the counterattacks section at the end of this class description. You learn an additional counterattack at level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19.

## Lineage

Bladesworn are sworn to a weapon that has been passed down in some fashion for generations. Virtually all of their power is gained by wielding or carrying it, drawing from its strength as they contribute their own. When you create a bladesworn, carefully think about this set of arms: the form it takes, its history, what special features it might possess, and the reason why it has been passed down. This set or arms need not literally be a blade: it could just as easily be a shield, a bow, a pair of daggers or so on.

You are always attuned to the set of arms you are bound to.

Every blade belongs to a Lineage: the reason why a long line of people have carried this weapon before you. At level 1, choose a Lineage, which offers unique features as you level up.

### Rhythmic Intensity

At level 1, your strikes grow in power as you lose yourself to the flow of battle. Your basic attacks and counterattacks gain a benefit based on the number of stacks of Rhythm that you currently have.

### Weapon Bond

Also at level 1, the bond between you and your sworn weapon is unbreakable. You effectively cannot lose your chosen weapon.

### Signature Technique

At level 11, your blade guides you, granting you access to a powerful counterattack unique to your Lineage.

### Direction

At level 14, you can feel the blade tugging you towards its own goals. When you use the Scan minor action your blade points at the path towards its favored objective as determined by your Lineage.

### Rhythmic Possession

At level 20, as the frenzy of battle washes over you completely, you become one with the blade you are sworn to. When you are at 5 stacks of Rhythm or above, you gain extremely powerful bonuses to your combat technique specific to your Lineage.

## Skill Memory

When you reach level 2, your connection to the past wielders of your weapon allows you to coax ancient knowledge from them. After you make a skill check, you may make a difficulty 15 Presence (Charm) skill check to convince them to guide you. On a success, you may treat your result as if you’d rolled a 15.

After you fail the Presence (Charm) skill check to use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a rest.

## Thrill of Battle

Also at level 2, you revel in the frenzy of battle. Whenever you strike with a basic attack, you may choose to spend an amount of essence up to your rhythm to gain four times that much life.

## Rhythmic Precision

At level 3, you dance with the music of battle, hypnotizing your foe with a flurry of steel. You have advantage on basic attacks and counterattacks against creatures you are threatening while you are at 1 or more Rhythm.

## Consolation

Also at level 3, the collective memories of the blade bolster you, giving you hope even when you fail. Whenever you miss with a basic attack or one of your counterattacks, regain 1 essence.

## Attribute Improvement
When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement
At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Joint Effort

At level 5, the blade you are sworn to watches out for you in battle, communicating when it detects threats or openings. You may take two reactions per round, instead of just one. You can only spend one reaction per triggering event, like usual, even if you were to use different abilities.

## Second Thought

At level 6, the weapon you are bound to is more alert, and able to guide you when you are in doubt. You have advantage on all Insight skill checks.

## Battle Dancing

At level 7, you learn to flawlessly dart in and out of the fray, leaving no opening for your opponents. While you are at 2 or more Rhythm, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you use the Dash minor action.

## Unshakable

At level 9, you are incredibly hard to deter or throw off, even when things go poorly. Once per round when you miss with a basic attack or counterattack, you may spend 1 essence to prevent it from resetting your Rhythm counter.

## Hidden Talent

At level 10, you learn to dig deep into the shared memories, accessing exceptional talents and hidden knowledge. Once per rest, you may choose to automatically succeed on the Presence (Charm) skill check made to use your Skill Memory class feature.

## Steel Tempest

At level 13, you attack and defend in a whirling flurry of steel. You may now take three reactions per round.

## Rhythmic Blur

At level 15, as your tempo grows, you tear through the battlefield in a beautiful dance of steel. When your Rhythm is 3 or more, your movement speed is doubled.

## Proactivity

At level 17, you learn to tweak your counterattack techniques to create openings from your enemy, rather than just waiting for them to appear. When you take the Strike major action, you may also spend 1 essence to gain the benefit of a counterattack that you know.

## Infallible

At level 18, the collective sentience of your blade watches over your work, catching your small mistakes. Whenever your party spends Resolve to set the roll of one of your skill checks to a 15, roll a d20. If this roll is greater than or equal to your original roll for that skill check, recover that Resolve.

# Lineages

## Virtuoso

Possessing talent beyond that of any mortal, the Virtuoso bladesworn live for the thrill and art of battle, putting on a spectacular show as they fight to be the very best.

### Rhythmic Intensity: Deadly Performance

At level 1, you dance across the battlefield in a beautiful whirlwind of deadly steel. Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack (or one of your counterattacks), deal additional damage to it equal to your Rhythm. The damage type is the same as the original attack, using the majority damage type if it is mixed (choosing in the event of a tie).

### Weapon Bond: Summoning

Also at level 1, the bond between you and your sworn weapon is unbreakable. As a minor action, you may summon your sworn weapon. No matter where it is, it appears instantly in your hand.

### Signature Technique: Parry

At level 11, your blade guides you, granting you access to a powerful counterattack unique to your Lineage.

#### Parry

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Reaction

**Range:** Weapon

**Duration:** Instant

Whenever a creature tries to make an attack of opportunity against you, you may spend a reaction to use this counterattack. Make an Expertise attack against that creature. If you hit, deal damage and apply effects as if you had landed a basic attack and their attack of opportunity automatically misses.

### Direction: Challenge

At level 14, you can feel the blade tugging you towards its own goals. When you use the Scan minor action your blade points at the path towards the most skilled opponent (based on level or tier) that you have not yet fought within a mile.

### Rhythmic Possession: Flawless

At level 20, as the frenzy of battle washes over you completely, you become one with the blade you are sworn to. When you are at 5 stacks of Rhythm or above, every basic attack and counterattack that you make automatically hits, no matter what you rolled. You should still roll to determine whether or not you landed a critical hit.

## Cursed Blade

Inescapably bound to their wielder, the Cursed Blade thirsts for blood, whispering in their ear incessantly. While the wielder ultimately decides how to respond to this temptation, and how to use the power offered, they must live with the knowledge that their soul will one day join the hungering voices.

### Rhythmic Intensity: Bloodlust

At level 1, you cut your way through the battlefield in an increasingly brutal fashion. The critical hit threshold for your basic attacks (and counterattacks) is reduced by your Rhythm.

### Weapon Bond: Inescapable Curse

Also at level 1, the bond between you and your sworn weapon is unbreakable. No matter what you might do, you cannot get rid of the thing. Whether you attempt to destroy it, give it away or lose it, it always reappears back in your possession by the end of your next natural rest. Immediately after you hit a creature with an attack with another weapon (and are not wielding this weapon), it suddenly appears in your hands instead, and you later discover the other weapon stowed safely away in your belongings.

### Signature Technique: Thirst

At level 11, your blade guides you, granting you access to a powerful counterattack that allows you to continue your deadly streak.

#### Thirst

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Reaction

**Range:** Weapon

**Duration:** Instant

Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 life, you may spend a reaction to use this counterattack. Make a Focus attack against another creature of your choice within range of your weapon. If you hit, deal damage and apply effects as if you had landed a basic attack and regain 1d6 life.

### Direction: Reaper

At level 14, you can feel the blade tugging you towards its own goals. When you use the Scan minor action your blade points towards the path to the creature closest to death (by percentage of life remaining) within a mile.

### Rhythmic Possession: Whirlwind

At level 20, as the frenzy of battle washes over you completely you become one with the blade you are sworn to, carving up everything in your path. When you are at 5 or more stacks of Rhythm, basic attacks (and counterattacks) you make target all creatures within your zone of control. Make sure to roll these attacks separately: missing on even one of these attacks resets your Rhythm to 0.

If your basic attacks are ranged, they instead hit all creatures within a cone with a length equal to the range of your weapon.

## Ancestral Guardian

Proud bearers of the revered armaments of their lineage (genetic or otherwise), Ancestral Guardians devote themselves to the protection of the things they hold dear, guided by the wisdom of their ancestors.

### Rhythmic Intensity: Stand Your Ground

At level 1, you stand firm in the face of overwhelming odds, bolstered by the heft of your blows. Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack (or one of your counterattacks), gain absorption equal to your Rhythm. If your attack was a critical hit, gain absorption equal to twice your Rhythm instead.

### Weapon Bond: Spirit Weapon

Also at level 1, the bond between you and your sworn weapon is unbreakable. The weapon you are bound to is spiritual in nature. It has a clearly otherworldly nature and appears out of thin air. As a minor action, you can cause your bound weapon to appear in your hands or disappear completely.

### Signature Technique: Intervene

At level 11, your blade guides you, granting you access to a powerful counterattack that protects your allies from harm.

#### Intervene

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Reaction

**Range:** Weapon

**Duration:** Instant

Whenever an ally is hit by an attack, you may spend a reaction to use this counterattack. Make an Agility attack against the creature who struck your ally. If you hit, deal damage and apply effects as if you had landed a basic attack, and your opponent must reroll the attack roll they just made. Your opponent uses the new result, hit or miss.

### Direction: Feud

At level 14, you can feel the blade tugging you towards its own goals. When you use the Scan minor action your blade points towards the path to the creature within one mile with the least loyalty towards you.

### Rhythmic Possession: Forebearers’ Fortification

At level 20, as the frenzy of battle washes over you completely, you become one with the blade you are sworn to. When you are at 5 stacks of Rhythm or above, you automatically gain the benefits of the Block reaction when you are hit with an attack. You may not use the Block reaction (or benefit from any other effects that grant its effect) while this effect is active.
