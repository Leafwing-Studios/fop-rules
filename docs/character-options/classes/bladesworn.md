# Bladesworn
**Source of Power:** Irrevocably bound to a sentient weapon, Bladesworn draw on the accumulated knowledge and skill of its past wielders, slowly contributing bits of their own soul back into the collective.

**Core Mechanic:** As the Bladesworn land attacks, responding to the shifting battlefield with powerful counterattacks, they fall deeper and deeper into the Rhythm of battle, accepting their weapon’s power as their blows land with increasing impact. 

**Specialization:** Every weapon belongs to a proud Lineage: defining its reason for existence. This choice dictates how the Bladesworn’s Rhythm improves their attacks, eventually granting access to a unique counterattack and a powerful capstone that grants them unbelievable power while at 5 or more stacks of Rhythm.

**Approach to Exploration:** Drawing on the accumulated knowledge of the past wielders, Bladesworn make for exceptional jack-of-all-trades, improving the results of their skill checks in a way that surpasses their personal proficiency. 

**Build Fundamentals:** Bladesworn make natural strikers, but can opt into the control roles with the right choices:
* Striker: Both stacking up afflictions and dealing direct damage can be effective routes to whittle your enemies down. If you choose to use a ranged weapon, be sure to pick counterattacks that you can reliably trigger to make sure you’re rarely left with excess reactions.
* Control: The *reach* arms affix is your best friend, letting you control and respond to the battle more effectively. Carefully force your opponents to play around your counterattacks, augmented by affixes like *imbued strikes* and *catching* to increase the disabling power of every basic attack.
