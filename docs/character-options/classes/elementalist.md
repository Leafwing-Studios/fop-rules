# Elementalist
**Source of Power:** Through careful study, Elementalists learn to balance the fundamental forces against each other in careful opposition, invoking elemental power to terrible effect.

**Core Mechanic:** As they mirror their spells, Elementalists must balance their elemental exposure carefully. As it rises, their power grows and they can no longer shield themselves from the intense elements. Left to grow unchecked, the elements detonate, unleashing massive power to everyone nearby.

**Specialization:** Each elementalist specializes in pairs of elements: at first, a single pair, and then a second, determining the flavor of the spells that they can cast.

**Approach to Exploration:** Elementalists gain access to powerful and unique element-focused utility spells and are unmatched in their knowledge of the elements they work with.

**Build Fundamentals:** Elementalists are easily built as strikers, but with the right choices they can serve as controllers or guardians instead:
* Striker: Double-down on critical strikes to get off detonation after detonation and blast everything to smithereens. Dash and Guard will be your most useful minor actions.
* Controller:  Focus on your conditions and forced movement, taking combat talents like *merciless* or *blowhard* and keep your exposure in the danger zone by alternating elements. The *telekinesis* affix lets you use the Shove minor action at long range, giving you more control from a safe distance, while the *patient* combat talent lets you get off more attacks of opportunity with your weapons to recover essence.
* Guardian: The barrier cycle of spells lets you give absorption to your allies; amplify its effectiveness with combat talents like *encouraging* or *supportive*. Youâ€™ll often find yourself using the Treat minor action, consider investing in affixes like *combat medic* to make it more effective.
