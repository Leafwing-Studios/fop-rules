# Introduction
*Fonts of Power* is a d20 tabletop roleplaying game system, designed to capture the wonder of exploring magical places.

Teeming with magic, the titular **fonts of power** have three defining characteristics: they are **dangerous, interesting,** and **magical.**

As a **player** in *Fonts of Power,* you will delve deep into these fonts as you seek your fortune, fight for your ideals, win allies, and learn more about the wonderous world in front of you. 

Take the story into your own hands, opting into risk, and you will earn **Resolve.** This powerful meta-currency can be used to recover from unlucky mistakes or to find the strength to press on to meet the challenges you’ve chosen to face.

As you adventure, you’ll find moments to catch your breath and reap the rewards of your escapades, taking advantage of a rich system of **downtime activities.** These moments of calm are precious and valuable, giving you the chance to hone your skills, forge meaningful bonds, create your own magical items and more.

Setting the stage for you and your friends, the **worldspeaker** breathes life into this world by creating fantastical monsters for the adventurers to fight and memorable settings for you to explore.

Rather than setting up the narrator of the world to drive the plot or act as the sole referee of the rules, *Fonts of Power* seeks to empower its players to drive the story forward and create characters that truly capture their fantasies. 


This system uses **collaborative rulekeeping;** by understanding the rules for yourself and playing fair, you can help make the worldspeaker role more accessible, and let them focus on truly making the world come to life for you to explore. 

## The World
The species, classes and other details described in this book paint a picture of a vibrant and diverse setting full of magic and budding technology that puts an optimistic steampunk twist on classic fantasy themes.

The world of *Fonts of Power* is a wondrous place: thriving and vibrant, but dotted with places of great and terrible magical power. Magic is the very essence of life: imbuing plants and animals with sentience, calling strange creatures into existence, and bringing the very land itself alive with wild and ancient power. As it concentrates, it coalesces into valuable **essence crystals** that serve as the currency of adventurers across the land. Left unchecked, the magic feeds upon itself, swallowing the very land as it becomes a dangerous font of power.

Every creature is, in some form, imbued with this magic. Every adventurer has their own source of this power, and, as they grow in power, must master the intricacies of their own source of magic and learn to control its dangerous excesses. Through their adventures, they discover, create, and earn magical **gear,** letting them focus, refine, and revise their capabilities as the situation demands.

These adventurers come from across the world to seek their fortune at the fonts of power. Humans, reclaimers, awakened, and automata venture forth from bustling cities. The sylvan, fae, and crystalline emerge from the wild places of the land. And the fontborn, slimes, and undead crawl, bounce, and lurch from the fonts of power themselves.

At the heart of it all, the fonts of power overflow with vibrant magic, teeming with strange **monsters** in a setting unlike anything else the world has ever seen. Seeded by a concentration of magical power, whether it was an erupting volcano, a sacred temple, or the remains of a terrible magical disaster, they amplify its character and contents into something truly fantastical.

Civilizations and fonts of power exist in an uneasy symbiosis: the people of the world exploit the fonts’ incredible power while the fonts feed on the magic of the countless souls lost to their hazards and inhabitants. Gritty frontier towns rise and fall as they eke out a dangerous but lucrative business supplying the cities with the magical resources they need to support their burgeoning technology.

Intentionally or incidentally, monsters serve as the hands, eyes and immune system of the fonts of power. Born from or drawn to its energy, they defend it from intruders, expand its domain, and turn those foolish enough to venture into the heart of the font back into the raw magic needed to fuel its growth.

Over the ages, fonts of power (and the factions that make up the civilizations) slowly grow and change, acting as living organisms on a nearly unimaginable scale. As they invade, defend and compete with each other they leave fragments of the past behind: **treasures, threats** and **clues** for adventurers like you to discover.

In the world of Fonts of Power, where the dungeons themselves want you dead, every character must answer one question: **why do you explore?**

**Playing Fonts of Power in other settings**

This system is purposefully designed to be adapted to your favorite settings and genres. When thinking about “what would a font of power be in my world?” come back to those three characteristics: dangerous, interesting and magical.

These are the critical ingredients needed to make sure places can serve as memorable backdrops for adventure. Fonts of power might be as small as a dragon’s lair, or sprawling as an untamed wilderness. They may be inhospitable alternate realities, or they could be a bustling city, brimming with crime, magic and intrigue. 

Fonts of power serve as thematic glue for the system, pushing your party towards adventure. All you need is a reason for players to want to explore them, and then add challenges to make doing so interesting.

## How to Use This Compendium
This compendium is divided into two sections: [Rules](rules/) and [Character Options.](character-options/) The Rules section contains the basic rules of the game, and is intended to be referenced at the table. The Character Options section covers everything you need to know to make your own characters in *Fonts of Power.*

*Fonts of Power* is a d20 system, similar to *Pathfinder* or modern *Dungeons & Dragons.* If you’ve played those before, many of our core mechanics should feel familiar, so that you can focus on learning the things that make our system unique.

**If you’re new to tabletop roleplaying games,** you should read the [Building Blocks of Play](intro/building-blocks.md) chapter coming up next, which introduces the core concepts needed to understand the rest of the rules.

**If you’re familiar with other d20 systems,** you can safely skip that chapter, and start with the [Narrative Mechanics](rules/narrative-mechanics/) chapter. If you’d prefer to dive straight into character creation, start with the [cheatsheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/115pncBLyu_PtpFPgmCXF2LOHutthUhYLn0xDJPIL9Po/edit#), which provide a quick summary of the essential rules of the game.

The rules for character creation are at the very beginning of the second half of the book, entitled [Character Options.](character-options/) Following that, you can find your choices for your **species, class, talents,** and **gear.** You should copy down these choices onto your **character sheet,** to make sure that you can quickly reference your character’s abilities while playing.

## Getting Started
*Fonts of Power* is best played in groups of 3-6. After you’ve read this book, you’ll need a few additional items to play the game. Digital alternatives to these tools exist, and may be preferred by some:
* A copy of the **rules of the game,** found in this book.
* [Character sheets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tNv3eBRoI_wg28S-e7h9KHyZcai-y-oS) with your characters’ statistics, [inventory](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hILGxE49G_lt8vIFywsUZDVPJ2MD4P0T) and features recorded.
* **Dice,** at least one each of standard size (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20). Multiple copies can be quite helpful for accelerating gameplay, and dice rolling tools are easy to find online.
* An **(erasable) battle mat** and **markers** to note terrain and designate created effects.
* Some sort of **tokens** which allow you to mark and distinguish the position of each character in combat. Figurines are fun and evocative, but even simple knickknacks such as differently colored buttons will work fine.

For the best gameplay experience, we also recommend:
* A copy of the *[Worldspeaker’s Guide to Fonts of Power](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WLBeS_Ei_BJYZnBafG6rWf7xODPFDSz8RQV2iA3WCU/edit#heading=h.zkka4gllffb)* to help you build monsters, design encounters and tell better stories.
